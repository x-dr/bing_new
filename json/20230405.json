They fan their tail feathers and inflate their necks while letting out a murmuring coo, hoping that a female selects them. This communal display is called lekking, and though we only see two birds here, these groups can number up to 200. Black grouse aren't the only animals known to participate in leks—bats, paper wasps, Atlantic cod, and fiddler crabs are among the many other species which go to the same lengths to find the right mate.","date":"Apr 5, 2023","bsTitle":"Ruffling feathers","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230405_BlackGrouseLekking%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b439ba0f0012372e858fb14e98501a24","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
