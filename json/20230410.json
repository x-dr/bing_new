Siblings Day is celebrated every April 10 in parts of the US and other areas of the world. In 1995, Claudia Evart, who lost her siblings at a young age, created this holiday and established the Siblings Day Foundation, which is working to get the holiday officially recognized in the US alongside Mother's Day and Father's Day. India's Raksha Bandhan is the oldest sibling holiday that is still widely observed today, usually falling in August. Hindu women commemorate this day by wrapping a band around their brothers' wrists as a sign of mutual care and respect. If this seems like too much, maybe just pick up the phone and give a loved one a call.","date":"Apr 10, 2023","bsTitle":"Strong sibling bonds","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230410_ElephantTwins%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2de3bb04432949a43144e39b4e4520cc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
