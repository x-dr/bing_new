Nestled in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile, this glacial lake reflects the towering peaks of the Cuernos del Paine, pictured here bathed in the sun's rays. The lake gets its color from finely ground rock particles and minerals, known as glacial flour, suspended in the water. The word 'paine,' pronounced pie-neh, in the park’s name is believed to have its roots in a Tehuelche word meaning 'blue' while 'torres' means towers. The park is named after three striking granite peaks that reach up to 8,200 feet above sea level but boasts many other spectacular mountains. At 700 square miles, Torres del Paine is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve with a huge amount to offer visitors, from hiking and kayaking to stargazing. So, pack your sense of adventure and head south to beat the blues.","date":"Nov 6, 2023","bsTitle":"Catching rays in Torres del Paine","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231106_LagoPehoe%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1f429449eae2717d3bb19701c1c117a0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
