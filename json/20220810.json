Joshua Tree was declared a national monument on August 10, 1936, before being designated a national park in 1994. Perhaps no other national park is so completely defined by a single feature, be it a plant or wildlife or natural formation. While Joshua Tree National Park contains other wonders, this tree that looks drawn by Dr. Seuss is what visitors come to celebrate.","date":"Aug 10, 2022","bsTitle":"Desert daggers?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220810_AnniversaryJTNP%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8ea8a1c7ef3d76c5e6dd30cf201bd338","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
