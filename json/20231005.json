Just as teachers shape minds and futures, nature too offers its own ways of passing knowledge. Nestled in the rocky landscapes of the Antarctic Peninsula and Antarctic islands, gentoo penguin hatchlings, born in pairs, benefit from dedicated parental support. The father and mother raise them in a bonded, monogamous pair, bringing food back to the stony nest they have built together. After being fed and raised for 30 days, the chicks join a larger flock known as a crèche or nursery for safety and to learn social behavior. Penguin parents and their community pass on their wisdom through the language of survival.","date":"Oct 5, 2023","bsTitle":"Here's how it's done!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231005_GentooJump%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2ff6068a871693bb8770e97be2deb671","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
