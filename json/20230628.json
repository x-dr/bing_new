This watershed moment—at a time when homosexuality was still illegal in most US states—launched an era of activism and resistance that would transform into a celebration of LGBTQIA+ love and pride. Today, Pride Month is observed in the United States and in dozens of countries around the world. Taking place every June, the month-long celebration of LGBTQIA+ communities also highlights their struggles and achievements. The goal of Pride is to promote the acceptance of love in all its forms, so that LGBTQIA+ communities have the respect, dignity, and equality they deserve.","date":"Jun 28, 2023","bsTitle":"The colors of Pride","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230628_PrideIceland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"00caa3be5de8eefa8aaf0a444a51cdf9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
