Its Egyptian lighthouse and Turkish elements are proof of different nations leaving their mark on Crete's old port. Forged in the 14th century under Venetian rule, this port has long served as a bustling hub for commerce and enterprise. For today's visitors, a replica of an old wooden sailing ship offers a full historic adventure. For a nostalgic inland experience, visit the 16th-century Fortezza, Rethymno's Venetian fortress. The citadel is visible from every corner of the town and offers a panoramic view of Rethymno.","date":"Sep 6, 2023","bsTitle":"Ready to drop anchor?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230906_CreteHarbor%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0ef36ad948fc3fcf57599ca329877823","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
