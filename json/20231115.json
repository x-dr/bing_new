In this national park, covering about 760 square miles of pristine wilderness, elk roam freely, golden eagles soar overhead, and the elusive arctic fox leaves traces of its presence in the snow. From the beauty of Abisko to the rugged peaks of Sarek, Sweden's many national parks boast a range of landscapes from glaciers to lush green forests and sandy beaches. The Sámi people have called this alpine region home since ancient times, and their cultural heritage is intertwined with the landscape. They fish the coasts, and perhaps most famously, herd reindeer.","date":"Nov 15, 2023","bsTitle":"Imagine the echo!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231115_SarekSweden%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a7c72f3ba8a74cf42f14ba60ac73d765","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
