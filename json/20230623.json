While they dine out on nectar, they get a light dusting of pollen, which is then spread to other flowers they land on. This process is pollination, transferring pollen from the male part of a flower to the female part, and is crucial for growing many of our fruits and vegetables. It improves the quality and quantity of crops and increases harvest yields. Nearly $20 billion of goods are produced in the US alone each year, because of pollination.","date":"Jun 23, 2023","bsTitle":"Butterfly, fly away","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230623_PollinatorMonarch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"466569a2b454912a9dce877d2bbbb895","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
