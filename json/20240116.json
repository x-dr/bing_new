The Indigenous Nakoda people refer to the lake as Ho-run-num-nay, meaning 'lake of the little fishes.' It was later renamed by settlers, inspired by Britain's Princess Louise, whose husband was governor general of Canada between 1878 and 1883. The adjoining hamlet is also called Lake Louise and, at an elevation of almost 5,200 feet, is Canada's highest community.","date":"Jan 16, 2024","bsTitle":"A little Canadian rest and relaxation","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240116_LakeLouise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0ff5fc27cf8d92b9b1704a9ca856fff6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
