Its towering Alcázar fortress and impressive Gothic cathedral dominate the skyline, but the city is also home to mosques and synagogues. Toledo bears strong cultural influences from the Moors, who ruled here for centuries, following their arrival in Spain in 711. It was known as the City of the Three Cultures during the Middle Ages, when its Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities coexisted harmoniously. Toledo has been the home of sword making since Roman times and is also famous for its marzipan. In the 16th century, the city was home to the famous painter El Greco, who was inspired to create some of his greatest masterpieces here.","date":"Nov 25, 2023","bsTitle":"Toledo's timeless tale","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231125_TajoRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f06dfc26595072ae659f2536092ab377","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
