When it opened in 1912, it was dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World. However, the triumph was short-lived. It was hit by a hurricane on Labor Day, 1935 and the railroad discontinued operations. The railway was sold to the US government and rebuilt as an automobile highway, opening in 1938.","date":"Aug 16, 2023","bsTitle":"On the open ocean road","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230816_KeyWestBridge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7286c14933975072eecccd05cc24ac24","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
