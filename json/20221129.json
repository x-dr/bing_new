The herons line the interior with moss, leaves, grass, and other softer materials, and tend to return to the same nesting site each year, though not the same nest. The male heron finds building materials while the female assembles the nest, then both birds maintain and add to it. The helpful male heron shown here is presenting his mate with nesting material—he seems an apt mascot for this year's Giving Tuesday.","date":"Nov 29, 2022","bsTitle":"A day for giving","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221129_HeronGiving%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d113d81f469c96bda2d895cfd32e31d2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
