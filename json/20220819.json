The remarkable feat took longer than a year and made the slow-flying plane part of aviation history. We are remembering this seminal flight today to mark National Aviation Day, established in 1939 by President Franklin Roosevelt as a day to celebrate the advancement of flight. August 19 was chosen because it is the birthdate of Orville Wright, who in 1903, with his brother Wilbur Wright, became the first to achieve powered, controlled flight on the hills of Kitty Hawk on North Carolina's Outer Banks.","date":"Aug 19, 2022","bsTitle":"A flight to remember","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220819_SolarImpulse2%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"4b81ecd7d26d2a7c5637ea2fbb9f32e4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
