This pod, off the Eastern Cape in South Africa, is employing an ingenious hunting technique, herding a school of frantic sardines toward the surface of the water so they have no escape, essentially driving them against a wall. Once pinned near the surface, the sardines are easy pickings for the hungry dolphins and any other lucky bystanders, like these dive-bombing Cape gannets who are quick to pounce on the opportunity. The technique requires teamwork of course but that comes easy to dolphins, known for their intelligence and tight familial bonds.","date":"Jun 8, 2022","bsTitle":"The buffet is open","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220608_CommonDolphin%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"602e8a443c20f3b6490d598be77a14b0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
