Instead, May 5 marks Mexico's victory over better-equipped French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. Although the French Empire would counterattack and take the city a year later, the unexpected victory was a morale boost which still has symbolic significance. While in the US, Cinco de Mayo is a popular festival celebrating Mexican American culture, celebrations in Mexico are relatively quiet and focused mostly on Puebla.","date":"May 5, 2023","bsTitle":"Celebrating Cinco de Mayo","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230505_Popocatepetl%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"44998b372d32864628fa036a88c4d8ea","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
