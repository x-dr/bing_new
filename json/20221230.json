Not quite. Today we're in Egypt's White Desert, which gets its colorful name from an abundance of chalk, limestone, and quartz rock formations that give the sand its special hue. Tourists flock to this place to see these naturally occurring structures, honed over thousands of years into unique shapes through a process known as differential weathering. Located about five hours to the southwest of Cairo, White Desert National Park is a lot more than just deteriorating rocks—it's also a protected refuge for several endangered animal species.","date":"Dec 30, 2022","bsTitle":"This snow will never melt","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221230_ChalkRock%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"27ec2627a6c9afe58da63bc9d0744b07","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
