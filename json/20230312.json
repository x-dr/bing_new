Built between 1904 and 1906, it was designed by the famous Austrian architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer in the Neo-Baroque style, popular in the late 19th century. This opulent style nodded back to the grandiosity of the Baroque movement, which began in Rome in the 1600s and flourished across Europe. The building houses both the national theater and the Romanian Opera and plays host to a wide array of cultural events here in Romania's second-largest city.","date":"Mar 12, 2023","bsTitle":"A real showstopper","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230312_TheaterRomania%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"8552ca6f3cec4622b3089d67904cbfb7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
