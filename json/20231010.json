Known as East Sopris and West Sopris, the two summits are both 12,965 feet in elevation, towering over the town of Carbondale, in the Roaring Fork Valley. It's a common misconception that Mount Sopris was a volcano but, although magma built up beneath its surface, it never erupted. Instead, it crystallized about 10,000 feet beneath the Earth's surface, creating a massive rock-covered dome. Erosion by rain, melting snow and glacial ice then shaped it into this twin-peaked giant over tens of millions of years.","date":"Oct 10, 2023","bsTitle":"Rocky Mountain high","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231010_SoprisSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7eefbcfa86c69b5504d2619f18cf8ffa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
