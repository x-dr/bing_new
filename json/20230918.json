The galaxy's name is derived from the radiant, pale appearance of the band of stars and gas clouds that graces Earth's sky. Methodical observations of the night sky started with early civilizations but astronomy, the oldest natural science, remains a source of fascination today. It's what brings stargazers to Portugal's Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park, a site free from heavy light pollution. Now's a good time to seek out your own celestial spectacle, as it is Astronomy Week and the main event, Saturday's Fall Astronomy Day, this year coincides with the autumnal equinox.","date":"Sep 18, 2023","bsTitle":"A rainbow's nocturnal cousin","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230918_MilkyWayPortugal%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e7fe00fb7b4bb2a00a246a2d0d3ec7be","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
