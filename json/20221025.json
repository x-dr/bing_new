We're taking you to Bomarzo, where a once-forgotten 16th-century garden holds monstrous sculptures that are meant to evoke anything but pleasure. In our photo, 'The Mouth of Orcus,' a Roman god of the underworld and punisher of broken oaths, gives visitors the feeling of being swallowed into the abyss. During a visit to the Parco dei Mostri (Park of the Monsters), as it's known, you'll come across other grotesque sights such as a dragon being attacked by lions, a giant shredding a man, and Hannibal's elephant snatching a Roman soldier.","date":"Oct 25, 2022","bsTitle":"Park of the Monsters","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221025_OrcusMouth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d09d1a00628f0f0474c73ca6b136ea38","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
