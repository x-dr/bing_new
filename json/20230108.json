Breckenridge is one of Colorado's premier ski and snowboard destinations. The resort has 35 lifts servicing five peaks and 2,900 acres of terrain. The visitors—who also arrive in the summer to fish, cycle, and paddle—easily outnumber the 5,000 residents of this quaint village. The gold mines have long shut down, apart from hosting visits from tourists. The enduring value of Breckenridge is its natural beauty.","date":"Jan 8, 2023","bsTitle":"Where we go to play","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230108_Breckenridge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e77fd45e345883c63da06bbcf7291e6b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
