Traditionally, Boxing Day is a day off to relax after the excitement of Christmas. What's behind the name? There are a few theories, but the most widely accepted one is that the name derives from the giving of 'boxes' (of gifts) to the poor the day after Christmas. Perhaps we should all follow that example today, as we eat Christmas leftovers and listen to lingering carols. How can we give a little Christmas to those who are less fortunate?","date":"Dec 26, 2022","bsTitle":"Giddy family fun","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221226_BeverleyWestwood%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"da2be5ddc22dc06e241de39485d784af","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
