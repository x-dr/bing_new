Congress established the day in 2002 with bipartisan support, and ever since, US government buildings, both domestic and abroad, fly the American flag at half-staff. Many citizens and businesses do the same in remembrance. Patriot Day also honors the hard work and sacrifice of the first responders who bravely put themselves in harm's way in the hours and days after the attacks.","date":"Sep 11, 2023","bsTitle":"A 'Tribute in Light'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230911_BridgeMemorial%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ac224a797ae91a12c7fbe097c5df0b8e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
