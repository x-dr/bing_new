On November 29, the Rockefeller Center Tree Lighting will bring you festive vibes. The roots of this holiday tradition go back to 1931, when builders put up a balsam fir to show gratitude for their jobs amid the bleakness of the Great Depression. That tree was decorated with paper garlands and tin cans and in 1933 the first tree-lighting ceremony took place. Today, this towering Norway spruce is adorned with over 50,000 multicolored LED lights and topped with a Swarovski crystal star. The illumination of the 80-foot tree is a full-blown extravaganza with musical performances and celebrity sightings. Its mesmerizing glow marks the official arrival of the holiday season in the city that never sleeps, and you don't want to miss it!","date":"Nov 29, 2023","bsTitle":"Rockefeller 'round the Christmas tree","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231129_TreeLighting%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"f5be82ebc1a1c91a096fe53251c7a7e2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
