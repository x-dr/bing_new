A magical moment to enjoy here is watching dozens of hot air balloons rising into the dawn sky. Every sunrise and sunset gives life to the 'fairy chimneys' of this striking region, mysterious towering rock formations reaching up to 130 feet high. The unusual landscape was formed over millions of years by volcanic eruptions. Another attraction here that you won't see from the air is Derinkuyu, a city dating from 1400 BCE that is completely underground. This subterranean city sheltered citizens from invaders who swept through over the centuries. When you experience the ancient wonders of Cappadocia, it's easier to understand how old the world is.","date":"Jun 9, 2023","bsTitle":"Rising with the sun","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230609_BalloonsTurkey%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"89568ff5027bc43473ded48286558d96","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
