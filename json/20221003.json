The update to the building, known as the Port House, was the vision that Zaha Hadid created with her team at Zaha Hadid Architects, which won a 2009 competition to build the new structure around a 1911 firehouse. Work was completed in 2016, the same year the famed architect died. The expansion is intended to resemble the hull of a sailing ship with a protruding bow glimmering with diamonds, recalling Antwerp's longtime trade in precious stones.","date":"Oct 3, 2022","bsTitle":"A future built on the past","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221003_Porthuis%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"6c14a7c600484d99202368c1abf38b8d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
