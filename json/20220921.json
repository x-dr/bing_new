This year's theme is 'End racism, build peace.' As the UN says, 'Achieving true peace entails much more than laying down arms. It requires the building of societies where all members feel that they can flourish. It involves creating a world in which people are treated equally, regardless of their race.'","date":"Sep 21, 2022","bsTitle":"A dramatic celebration of peace","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220921_PWPeaceDoves%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"51c8f937f09da3993d69f33ed46b0ccd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
