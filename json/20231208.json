Found on the southeastern shore of the island is La Rocque Harbour, home to a white, sandy beach and an elevated walkway that stretches out into the water. The shoreline's granite and plutonic rocks, which originated more than 420 million years ago, showcase a variety of colors and textures. Visible from the harbor are the round, stubby Icho Tower and the taller Seymour Tower, built in the 18th and 19th centuries respectively as coastal defense structures. Both structures are over 1,800 feet away from the shore and can be reached on foot with a sturdy pair of shoes, but only on the days of the year where the tide is lowest.","date":"Dec 8, 2023","bsTitle":"Not that Jersey Shore","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231208_JerseyIsland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6e1c37c9ef5f77cde0aecaffe3c3d2d2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
