He stood for advances in civil rights, nonviolent resistance, and a dream of racial harmony. In 1983, the third Monday of January was made a federal holiday to mark his birthday, which was on January 15. It's the only federal holiday that's designated as a national day of service and the 'day on, not a day off' continues to inspire unity, progress, and the ongoing struggle for equality.","date":"Jan 15, 2024","bsTitle":"A day on, not a day off","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240115_MLKMemorialDC%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"d64e0f8be485e87cc3e5afc31e415f26","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
