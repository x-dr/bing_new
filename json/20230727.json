Today's image shows the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel at the eastern end of the route, with the embodiment of Peace riding a chariot atop it. It shouldn't be confused with the better-known and much larger Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile, which stands 2 miles away, halfway along the Axe historique. It's a lovely walk from one to the other, through the Jardin Des Tuileries and along the famous Avenue des Champs-Élysées. If the statue on the left side of the photo caught your eye, wave hello to King Louis XIV on horseback.","date":"Jul 27, 2023","bsTitle":"Another Arc de Triomphe?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230727_ParisLouvre%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d3f960fea7ddc21998922dfb8ec39b71","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
