In less than two hours, Gagarin completed a full orbit of the Earth in the Vostok 3KA spacecraft. Less than a month later, Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space. The spectacle of looking back at Earth from space has not lost its charm, as you can see in today's picture taken from the International Space Station. Also known as the 'World Space Party,' Yuri's Night is a global celebration of astronomy and a reflection on how space exploration can unite people in a divided world.","date":"Apr 12, 2023","bsTitle":"A view that's out of this world","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230412_EuropeFromISS%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"89bebc08da423593f4f9bfa1e3e3a35c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
