Screaming is optional. It's National Roller Coaster Day and we're waiting in line at Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey, for our ride on the Great White. A hybrid wooden and steel coaster, it's been in operation since 1996 and reaches its highest point 110 feet above the ground. Coaster enthusiasts point out the ride's dip under the pier shortly after the start as one of its highlights. It's also noted for a portion of the ride swinging out over the nearby beach.","date":"Aug 16, 2022","bsTitle":"Thrill ride","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220816_GreatWhiteRoller%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b3b0d9107e0dc45caf4a3b9275bd027b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
