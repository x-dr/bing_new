The park also boasts stunning pathways, unique rock formations, and numerous wild animals. It's not certain where the name Taughannock came from, though a leading theory says it is a combination of Iroquois and Algonquin terms, roughly translating to 'great fall in the woods.' The park, which was founded in 1924, guarantees visitors memorable adventures, whether you hike the rim paths for panoramic views of the falls and rock formations, take a plunge in Cayuga Lake, or bring a pair of binoculars for birding. A keen eye can spot winged locals such as turkey vultures, common loons, and great horned owls.","date":"Oct 6, 2023","bsTitle":"Nature's majesty awaits!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231006_TaughannockFalls%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f45826668c2f34ae3c4875fb4ff22ab8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
