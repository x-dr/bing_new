The park displays architecture and landscapes that evoke ancient and medieval eras, like this recreation of a Roman-style aqueduct. These features are brought to life by the garden's lush greenery, tranquil water, and intricately crafted sculptures throughout the grounds, which illustrate the beauty of intermingled nature and art. Today, Arkadia Park stands as a testament to Helena Radziwiłłowa's lasting vision and creative legacy.","date":"Sep 20, 2023","bsTitle":"Water under and over the bridge","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230920_ArkadiaPark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"15128bb2694289b58834d103fad75b29","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
