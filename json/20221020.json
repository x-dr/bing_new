Your answer depends on how highly you rate the ability to just laze around all day, but in honor of International Sloth Day, let's all just embrace slothfulness. If you want to live the sloth life, head outside and hang upside down in the nearest tree. You won't be able to dangle there as long as a sloth though, because they spend most of their lives doing it. Their arms, legs, hands, and feet evolved for literally 'hanging around' like the pair of Hoffmann's two-toed sloths in today's photo.","date":"Oct 20, 2022","bsTitle":"Hangin' around","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221020_SlothDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"de92f2a67ce628894002215b23da50ce","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
