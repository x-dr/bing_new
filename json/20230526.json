The park is dotted with ancient temples, the remains of a palace, and towering Buddha statues—within its boundaries is the historic town of Sukhothai, an important metropolitan hub in the 13th and 14th centuries. The name translates as 'the dawn of happiness' and you can spend many happy hours here, strolling among the beautiful lawns, trees, and lakes. The temple on our homepage is Wat Si Sawai, one of the oldest on the site, founded in the late 12th or early 13th century. Sukhothai was the capital of the first Kingdom of Siam more than 700 years ago and this historic site continues to offer a window onto what is sometimes seen as a golden age of Thai civilization.","date":"May 26, 2023","bsTitle":"The splendors of Sukhothai","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230526_WatSriSawai%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"81f7a296e1b74f60401498f17c4371b0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
