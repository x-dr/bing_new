This is one of the most heavily visited recreation areas in Montana, especially for those who like to fish. Late-1800s logging operations in the surrounding forest damaged the habitat for trout in Hyalite Creek, but stream restoration projects have increased trout populations to such an extent that this is now considered a world-class destination for fly fishing.","date":"May 29, 2022","bsTitle":"An angler's paradise","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220529_HyaliteCreek%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"feebdf52e6edd8b20f9d38b88d2e5dcc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
