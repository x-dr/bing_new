We start Black History Month here in Little Rock, the state capital of Arkansas, at the Little Rock Nine Monument, named for that group of kids who played an important role in desegregating public schools. Their contributions to the civil rights movement are a moving reminder of how far we've come as a nation, and of how very different life was for Black Americans not so long ago.","date":"Feb 1, 2023","bsTitle":"Courage and conviction","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230201_LittleRockNine%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"6a0435c8b83dcc902e10d31f39ed2e7b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
