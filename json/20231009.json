In the US, the second Monday in October is dedicated to the enduring cultures that have shaped the nation. Among them are the Fremont people, who lived in and around what is now Utah, for more than 1,000 years up to 1300 CE. This broad group of communities left a lasting mark on their region with their distinctive petroglyphs, a form of ancient art chipped or carved into rock. Today, many Americans participate in Indigenous Day celebrations such as art exhibitions, traditional music, and storytelling. Locations such as Dinosaur National Monument, Fremont Indian State Park, and McKee Spring provide insights into the history of this ancient culture that lived here for centuries.","date":"Oct 9, 2023","bsTitle":"Celebrating Indigenous heritage","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231009_FremontPetroglyph%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e8c28be13b5c54a76655b880f2b9de67","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
