We each have our own traditions, from filling stockings to hosting parties and playing festive music. Today's twilight homepage shows the gleaming lights and Christmas trees of Town Hall Square in Tartu, Estonia's second-largest city.

Whether you're partying or cozying up with a cup of hot cocoa, embrace the Christmas spirit on this peaceful night—and don't forget the milk and cookies!","date":"Dec 24, 2023","bsTitle":"How lovely are your branches","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231224_EstoniaXmasEve%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cb0dc2ce6a234e828f2f77fb6bd4339f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
