From beluga whales and northern lights to the shipwreck of the SS Ithaka and the Sea Walls murals, there are many surprises here. Moreover, it is also known as the 'polar bear capital of the world', thanks to its seasonal visitors. From October to November, these white giants pass through, waiting for Hudson Bay to freeze over so they can head out to hunt seals. Tourists can safely watch polar bears from the comfort of custom-built vehicles and a so-called 'polar bear jail' helps to manage bear-human interactions. Are you ready for a wild adventure that'll send chills down your spine, but in a good way?","date":"Nov 18, 2023","bsTitle":"Awaiting the big freeze","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231118_MilsePolarBear%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"db4943a095477f96d7f6d4f3eba24174","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
