To get a close-up view of the Wave, a whorled sandstone formation in the northern Arizona wilderness, you'd have to navigate a rugged and mostly trail-free hiking route in typically scorching temperatures. You'd also need to have a permit in your pocket. To protect the landscape, only a small number of permits are available, offered through a daily lottery. But maybe for you the journey is at least as important as the destination? If so, this is just one hike of many in the expansive Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs National Monument, which protects more than 100,000 acres of Arizona and Utah canyonland.","date":"Jul 17, 2022","bsTitle":"Ride the wave","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220717_CoyoteButtes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4a35c5dd56a562968225f46c1397e546","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
