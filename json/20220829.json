Strictly speaking, it is in fact a sea and thus appropriately named, joined to the Atlantic Ocean through three straits in Denmark: the Öresund, Great Belt, and Little Belt. Technically, the Baltic is classified as a brackish sea, meaning it is not entirely fresh and not entirely saline. The Baltic Sea isn't landlocked, but it does border many countries, including Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia—and it's the Estonian coast featured in today's image.","date":"Aug 29, 2022","bsTitle":"The sea that acts like a lake","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220829_EstoniaBaltic%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c99b9b151e6b2b6ea7933ff6b8cf5a95","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
