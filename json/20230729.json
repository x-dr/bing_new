A day to celebrate these magnificent animals and consider how best they can be protected. The largest wild cats in the world, all tiger species are endangered, facing challenges including habitat loss, the illegal wildlife trade, and poaching. The Bengal tiger, an iconic subspecies primarily found in India, is the star of today's image.
