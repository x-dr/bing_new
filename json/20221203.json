Art Basel Miami Beach, which wraps up its three-day run today, is the American leg of an international art fair also staged in Basel, Switzerland (where the festival started in 1970), Hong Kong, and Paris. The event, now 20 years old, is the most comprehensive contemporary art fair in North America, attracting thousands of artists, dealers, collectors, appreciators, and just fun-seeking tourists for this annual burst of creativity steps from the sand.","date":"Dec 3, 2022","bsTitle":"Chasing summer in the art world","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221203_MiamiDT%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"69b5fcd5f75e437a8a9013bb8d55a79f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
