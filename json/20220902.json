This big little island is small enough to drive across in a few hours but full of wonders, from mountain ranges to gorges to beautiful beaches. Take this jewel box of turquoise water near the port city of Chania, for example. Set on the easternmost of three peninsulas that stick out like horns from the northwest shoreline of Crete, Seitan Limania is one of the most photographed beaches on the island.","date":"Sep 2, 2022","bsTitle":"This magical beach is worth the hike","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220902_SeitanLimania%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"616016433f43b1df115e420405315241","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
