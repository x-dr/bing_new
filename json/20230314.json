It's the day we celebrate the mathematical constant π. Today's date, March 14, was chosen because when expressed numerically, it matches the first three digits of pi: 3.14. You remember pi from geometry class—it's the ratio of the distance around a circle to the distance across it. Pi is used to compute a circle's area and circumference. The circular labyrinth at the Cyherbia Botanical Park brings the ratio to life and is a must-visit for people who love to solve puzzles. If you're ready for a challenge, give it a go.","date":"Mar 14, 2023","bsTitle":"A beautiful labyrinth","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230314_CyprusMaze%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"aef7d2eda62bbd358c24db4ef0d76c33","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
