Their colorful plumage and ability to hover mid-air make them particularly eye-catching. The rapid flapping of their wings—an average of 53 times a second—creates their trademark humming sound and works up quite an appetite: These little birdies can feed every 10–15 minutes! Today's homepage star is an Allen's hummingbird, which grows to about 3.5 inches in length and is found along the west coast of North America, most commonly in California. National Hummingbird Day aims to boost the preservation of these mini marvels, by protecting them and their habitat.","date":"Sep 2, 2023","bsTitle":"Stopping for a blossom beverage","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230902_TinyHummer%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"abc2a32af6c7830a19997e463bafdc50","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
