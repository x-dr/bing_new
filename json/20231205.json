Neuschwanstein Castle, on the left of our homepage image, was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Building work began in 1869 on this Romanesque Revival palace with its fairy-tale-like architecture and breathtaking mountain backdrop. Across the valley, gazing out over Lake Alpsee, is the equally spectacular Hohenschwangau Castle, built by Ludwig II's father, King Maximilian II of Bavaria. These two castles boast rich interiors with intricate artwork and historical artifacts. Both castles attract millions of visitors every year, offering a glimpse into the opulent past of Bavaria.","date":"Dec 5, 2023","bsTitle":"Straight out of a fairy tale","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231205_AlpsCastles%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0309c2a00edc29b521fe8b18c6608ec5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
