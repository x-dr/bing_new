Japanese bombers and submarines struck the island of Oahu, taking the lives of 2,403 Americans and damaging or destroying over 300 airplanes and nearly 20% of the 100-ship Pacific Fleet. The United States entered World War II immediately after the attack, and the event hastened Hawaii's path to become the 50th state to join the union. As 82 years have passed, few veterans of Pearl Harbor are still alive today. Lou Conter, the last surviving crew member of the USS Arizona, its memorial seen here, turned 102 in September. So, thank you to Lou, and all others who served our country on that infamous day.","date":"Dec 7, 2023","bsTitle":"Remembering the fallen","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231207_PearlHarborArizona%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"4e0b20f7f392ff472365682bcfa67d12","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
