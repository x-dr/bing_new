With that friendly smile, you might think this pygmy three-toed sloth is inviting you to hang out, but these animals are not easy to find. Also known as the monk sloth or dwarf sloth, the species lives exclusively on a small island off Panama's coast, Isla Escudo de Veraguas. Pygmy three-toed sloths are much smaller than other kinds of sloths, at about 20 inches long, and they weigh less than 8 pounds. Sadly, this species is classified as critically endangered. International Sloth Day aims to raise awareness of the planet's slowest mammal and help them to survive and thrive in the wild, at their own pace.","date":"Oct 20, 2023","bsTitle":"Do you wanna hang?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231020_PygmySloth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ec46362c7b978ac6e61c01f55be536c5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
