According to Italian folklore, the last three days of January are the coldest of the year and are referred to as the 'days of the blackbird.' One local legend gives a fun take on how blackbirds got their dark feathers: To protect her young chicks from the cold Northern Italian winter, a mother bird with white feathers built her nest in a chimney. After her white chicks emerged from their eggs, their feathers turned black from the chimney's soot, and from that day on, all such birds were born as 'blackbirds.'","date":"Jan 29, 2023","bsTitle":"Days of the blackbird","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230129_BlackbirdDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"45448c996b0d95b0ce69d5dc5026581f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
