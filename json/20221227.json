While that may not sound enticing, Iceland's Blue Lagoon is one of the country's most-visited attractions. The trick is to not get stuck on the 'waste' part of wastewater. The water here is clean, always hovers around 100° F, and is enriched with tons of silica—which is what makes it blue—and sulfur, thanks to the plant's processes. Those minerals, along with a little algae, are believed to combine into a highly beneficial tonic for skin and overall well-being.","date":"Dec 27, 2022","bsTitle":"The healing powers of wastewater","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221227_BlueLagoon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9812417bde9c91f6794f0ca45d98ce9b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
