With speeds up to 70 miles per hour, cheetahs thrive on the open savanna, always on alert for signs of prey. While the Maasai Mara is known for its exceptional East African cheetah population, globally the species' survival is threatened by habitat loss and human influence. Today, which is both International Cheetah Day and Wildlife Conservation Day, let's raise awareness about the cheetah's plight. It's a day to appreciate the beauty and importance of not just these wild cats, but all wildlife that shares the world with us.","date":"Dec 4, 2023","bsTitle":"Masters of agility and cuteness","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231204_CheetahDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c1c9243083a22950c787330a9a5f87a1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
