The Grand Staircase is a sequence of five majestic sandstone cliffs, rising approximately 5,500 feet across the expanse of the monument. Each step records a different era in Earth's geological history, a vast showcase of changes over 200 million years. Archaeologists have found prehistoric artifacts, petrified wood, and dinosaur fossils which are over 75 million years old. In human history, the Ancestral Puebloan and Fremont people mastered the art of farming in this challenging terrain. They constructed granaries to store and preserve their harvests. Today, it is a popular getaway for nature enthusiasts and travelers seeking adventure.","date":"Oct 25, 2023","bsTitle":"A pop of autumn gold","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231025_GrandStaircase%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"47b36734dc0de46c8c731dad784d3dc6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
