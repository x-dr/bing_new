It's a feast for birds and birders alike, as the raptors tear into a never-ending supply of tasty fish. The largest congregation of eagles in the world, it's celebrated by the annual Alaska Bald Eagle Festival in the second week of November. The event features live raptor demonstrations, educational programs, guided hikes, and live music.","date":"Nov 12, 2022","bsTitle":"A convocation of eagles assembles","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221112_HainesEagle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b27ba83c32db39306cc011eb7b905cbd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
