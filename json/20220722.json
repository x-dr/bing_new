One of the brothers had injured his leg on the journey, but in the morning it had healed. Taking this as an omen, they vowed to honor the Virgin Mary by building her a church on the spot where they'd found the icon. They began dropping stones there, and even scuttling old ships. A tradition was born, and over decades, the fishermen of Perast would drop a stone in the water at that spot before heading to sea.","date":"Jul 22, 2022","bsTitle":"An island made from a vow","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220722_SGIMontenegro%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d942936ad3d920ee75092a86446f93b2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
