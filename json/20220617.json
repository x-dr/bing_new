The region's harsh weather means that only the hardiest of wildflowers can survive, and the bright yellow arrowleaves fit the bill. The plants are drought-tolerant, impervious to winter, tenacious against trampling, and even fire-resistant, with a taproot that regenerates leaves and flowers after the top has burned.","date":"Jun 17, 2022","bsTitle":"A grand view","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220617_Balsamroot%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"74ce4d7f7498c5cb9a0b20aa1199a558","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
