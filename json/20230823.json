This powerful cascade measures 82 feet across and drops 200 feet over what were once the sea cliffs of the country’s southern coast. The coastline receded seaward, but the cliffs remained, leaving behind this natural wonder, powered by water from two glaciers. Skógafoss, which translates as 'forest waterfall,' is frequently graced with single or double rainbows, formed by the refraction of sunlight through the mist. Legend has it that a treasure chest is hidden behind Skógafoss, left there by a Viking settler named Prasi Porolfsson.","date":"Aug 23, 2023","bsTitle":"Making a splash","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230823_SkogafossWaterfall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"78e3c5f119e8db521beeecddfc7dead4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
