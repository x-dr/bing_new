Tramping, New Zealand-speak for hiking, is incredibly popular at Milford Sound. Nearly a million tourists visit the fjord every year, despite its somewhat remote location. Originally overlooked by European explorers, the area is now known for its beauty and abundance of wildlife. It's not uncommon for visitors to spot dolphins, humpback whales, and native Fiordland penguins.","date":"Jul 30, 2022","bsTitle":"The 'eighth wonder'?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220730_FiordlandRainforest%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"499acffbf165c3d15dfe448daaa4a4b1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
