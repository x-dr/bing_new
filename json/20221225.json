Including displays such as this miniature village decorated for the holidays. Craftsmen and merchants sell ornaments and other gifts at Strasbourg's famous Christmas market. And there are plenty of satisfied customers—over 2 million visitors flock to the city every year to take in the festive sights and sounds.

It's no wonder that Strasbourg proudly calls itself the 'Capital of Christmas.'","date":"Dec 25, 2022","bsTitle":"Have a merry little Christmas","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221225_ChristmasSouvenir%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4656933318f8aa888465cba4db359cf8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
