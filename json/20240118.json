Arching over the Seine, the bridge was opened in 1900 and named after a Russian tsar, celebrating a new alliance between the two countries. Befitting the nobility of the event, two 56-foot columns sit on each bank of the river, crowned with gilt-bronze sculptures of the winged horse Pegasus. From the center of the bridge, standing above reliefs decorated with nymphs and beneath Art Nouveau-style lamps, you can admire some famous Parisian monuments. Views include the Esplanade des Invalides, the Grand Palais and Petit Palais museums, and the Eiffel Tower.","date":"Jan 18, 2024","bsTitle":"Under the watch of Pegasus","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240118_ParisBridge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d2d5e071a3a6ce763e2e80798ddf6e8f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
