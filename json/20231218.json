The park was named after a series of Navajo sandstone domes said to resemble the US Capitol Building and the Waterpocket Fold, a huge ridge in the Earth's crust, which was referred to as a reef by prospectors. This 100-mile-long monocline—a step-like fold—is thought to have formed around 50 to 70 million years ago, and is home to towering cliffs, narrow canyons, and colorful rock formations. Capitol Reef was established as a national monument in 1937 and was designated a national park on December 18, 1971.","date":"Dec 18, 2023","bsTitle":"Snow, snow on the range","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231218_CapitolReefSnow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1ccccad81dade4a86fda115edfc7ce41","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
