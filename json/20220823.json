It's prized for its beauty and incredible weather that features an average of 316 days a year with full or partial sun. That climate enables Menton to enjoy amazing lemon yields that have given rise to the annual Fête du Citron, or Menton Lemon Festival, a 17-day extravaganza in February featuring floats and sculptures created out of lemons and oranges. More than 200,000 visitors marvel at the nearly 150 tons of fruit used in the festival.","date":"Aug 23, 2022","bsTitle":"If given Menton, make lemonade","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220823_MentonFrance%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1a99e78180aa5a57da9c74e01d1381ed","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
