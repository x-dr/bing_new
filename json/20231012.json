It's time to express our gratitude toward the harvesting heroes, the guardians of crops: farmers. Farmer's Day is a celebration of determination and a deep-rooted relationship with the land. From dusk to dawn throughout the seasons, farmers work tirelessly to ensure that produce shelves stay stocked. The interior northwest's Palouse region is one of the country's most fertile farming regions, with rolling hills of wheat, legumes, and canola, as seen here today. Old barns with rusty roofs and weathered wood tell tales of harvests and hardships faced by generations of farmers. So, when you eat your next meal, we encourage you to take a moment and think of the workers who produced that food from the land.","date":"Oct 12, 2023","bsTitle":"Make hay while the sun shines","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231012_IdahoBarn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"16188483fbed55430d868db1bd4bd7ca","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
