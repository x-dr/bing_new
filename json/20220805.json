Today the castle hosts the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, a full-on Scottish experience, with bagpipes, drums, and seemingly enough kilts to cover all of Scotland. Enthusiastic visitors can also indulge in whisky and haggis in one of the many hostelries on the Royal Mile, the colorful, bustling historic street that wends its way from the castle down to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, Queen Elizabeth II's official residence in Scotland.","date":"Aug 5, 2022","bsTitle":"Festival fever","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220805_MilitaryTattoo%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fd1c4063df337dc581b8fc4bdfa53dd1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
