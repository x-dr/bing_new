Built in the 12th century, this Roman Catholic church has an eclectic architecture style that combines Romanesque and Gothic influences with later Baroque additions. The space inside the cathedral is artfully decorated with blue and white azulejo tiles, which showcase some scenes from the Bible. Tiles like these are found throughout Portuguese cities, on apartment buildings, churches, and public buildings.","date":"Jun 10, 2023","bsTitle":"Blue hues and ceramic scenes of Porto","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230610_PortugalDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5e5b95e75aa217aab2b3812883fc5fe9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
