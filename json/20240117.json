This park covers 93 square miles of the wider forest, where it sits on Germany's border with Czechia. The softly rolling mountains Great Rachel, Little Rachel, and Little Arber pose modest challenges for hikers as they wander through stands of Norway spruce. The forest teems with life, including lynxes, bears, pygmy owls, and Eurasian wolves, like our sleepy homepage friend. These wolves form a close-knit pack led by an alpha pair and have been spotted in the park after decades of being hunted out of Western Europe.","date":"Jan 17, 2024","bsTitle":"Wake me when it warms up","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240117_SleepyWolf%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d34059879875ced1d4a4c23dbedab855","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
