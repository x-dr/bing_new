Did you stay up late to ring in the new year? If so, we wouldn't blame you for sleeping in like this red fox in Abruzzo, Italy. Whenever you wake up, New Year's Day is a great opportunity for reflection, planning, and a sense of renewal for the year ahead. January 1 has been a big day since the Julian calendar was widely adopted in 45 BCE—modified in 1582 by the Gregorian calendar to better calculate for leap years. Whether you're watching a parade, attending a sports game, taking a chilly dip, or writing resolutions, we hope it's the beginning of a great year to come.","date":"Jan 1, 2024","bsTitle":"Wake up, it's 2024!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240101_SleepingFox%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2ca10763bace0838b7bbaca77a33c2a5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
