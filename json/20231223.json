Sometimes you might be tempted to channel this chinstrap penguin and give your nearest and dearest an earful. If you need a break from all the seasonal joy, Festivus might be the holiday for you. The idea was popularized in a 'Seinfeld' episode, which detailed the Costanza family's December 23 traditions, including putting up an unadorned aluminum Festivus pole and airing their year-end personal grievances. Since the episode debuted in 1997, Festivus has taken on a life of its own both among fans and people looking for an alternative way to celebrate the season. While most embrace the trappings of the holiday season, Festivus is for the rest of us.","date":"Dec 23, 2023","bsTitle":"They've got some things to say","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231223_FestivusPenguins%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"786ffc1f3a19e88737e9c2bfc747a21a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
