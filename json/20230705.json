Those who make the journey are rewarded with two stunning coves, offering a unique double-beach experience. With clear turquoise waters and dramatic cliffs, Porto Timoni presents a picturesque coastal panorama. Surrounding the beach, lush olive groves and cypress trees add to its charm. Greek islands like Corfu may seem timeless and ancient but they are relatively new in the history of Earth. A leading theory is that around 5.3 million years ago, a great flood poured in between Africa and Europe from the Atlantic Ocean, an event called the Zanclean flood. Lakes became oceans and what were previously mountaintops became islands.","date":"Jul 5, 2023","bsTitle":"Pick your paradise","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230705_CorfuBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3c0014237547cbd1d20d3179e9d7b2c6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
