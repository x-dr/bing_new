Just outside of the ancient city of Pisa in Tuscany is the Regional Park of Migliarino, San Rossore, Massaciuccoli. This immense and diverse park boasts numerous distinct environments. A visitor will discover, by turns, seaside sand dunes, marshlands, and vast forests of pine, oak, and elm. A wide array of birds can also be found in the park, along with ample wild boar, rabbits, red foxes, and the impressively antlered fallow deer. It's even been suggested that there are wolves living in the deep reaches of the woods.","date":"Aug 30, 2022","bsTitle":"There's more to Pisa than leaning towers","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220830_Migliarino%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3915c85819f8062a18baa13923086980","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
