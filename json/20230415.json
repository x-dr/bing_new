There is perhaps no better day to ponder these iconic words by Oscar Wilde than World Art Day. Celebrated each April 15, it marks the birthday of Renaissance luminary Leonardo da Vinci. The celebration, which started in 2012, continues to be a beautiful reminder of the power of art and its ability to heal, strengthen, and inspire society. The sculpture in today's image, Italian artist Lorenzo Quinn's 'Together,' displayed near the Great Pyramids of Giza, serves as a fitting commentary on this inimitable power of art and also a symbol of the unbreakable human connection.","date":"Apr 15, 2023","bsTitle":"When art imitates life","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230415_LorenzoQuinn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"ac5bb1493dfd7f004ba97fca8c5aed4d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
