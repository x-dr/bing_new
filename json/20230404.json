For 2,000 years it was the city’s only bridge across the Guadalquivir River, originally built in the first century BCE during the expansion of the Roman Empire. Much of the current bridge dates from reconstruction in the 8th century following the Moorish conquest, a period when hundreds of mosques and palaces were built, and Córdoba became one of Europe's largest cities and a center of learning and culture.","date":"Apr 4, 2023","bsTitle":"The historic heart of Córdoba","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230404_RomanBridge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a4b82856c5f106e157e37640827fceb5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
