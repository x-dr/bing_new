Humpback whales, like the one in our homepage image, can be found in all oceans and have among the world’s longest migrations, traveling thousands of miles from tropical breeding grounds to colder waters in search of food. They are also known for their haunting 'songs.' There are many theories about why they sing, but some research suggests it might be a sign of loneliness. The good news is, that a global ban on commercial whaling has seen their numbers increase, so there is less need for whales to feel lonely.","date":"Jun 8, 2023","bsTitle":"Where the humpback whale sings","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230608_PlayfulHumpback%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"00f157f599c5f985fc160dd233263e62","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
