As you may know, 'Game of Thrones' filmed here frequently throughout the run of the show, and you can scarcely blame them; Dubrovnik's Old Town is one of the best-preserved medieval cities in the world. For centuries it flourished as the Republic of Ragusa, maintaining independence through diplomacy and robust trade networks. This 'Pearl of the Adriatic' has withstood military bombardments and devastating earthquakes, yet the city has always rebuilt and persevered. While pop culture, history, and UNESCO World Heritage Site status are all big draws, they might be too effective: A recent report estimated that in 2019 there were 36 tourists for every resident.","date":"Aug 28, 2023","bsTitle":"Watch out for dragons!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230828_DubrovnikHarbor%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"95be157dcc0053b72b9429abaab2fba6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
