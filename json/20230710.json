While it’s nice to look at, the Romans likely brought it with them for its many practical uses, including cooking, repelling insects, and as an antiseptic. Many perfumes, modern and historical, have featured lavender, and Queen Elizabeth I is purported to have used lavender scent. You’ll find lavender fields scattered across the country. This one is a typical example, a quintessential summer sight here in the picturesque county of Somerset, in southwest England.","date":"Jul 10, 2023","bsTitle":"A scented sea of purple","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230710_SomersetLavender%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a52635fc692b3065e8fac3f78900c58d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
