This photo gives you an idea just how many people will be running today. Because the race starts early on a November morning, many runners show up in layered clothing to beat the typical chill. But once they heat up from running, those layers come off and are often discarded on sidewalks. Race organizers collect the activewear left behind by 50,000 runners, about 26 tons a year, and donate it to charity.","date":"Nov 6, 2022","bsTitle":"Racing through the five boroughs","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221106_MarathonSunday%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a52bfb3866ef8e41a3da64684412de1c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
