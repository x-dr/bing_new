Due to its improvisational nature, jazz never stays the same, fusing with other cultures and genres to create styles such as Afro-Cuban, Latin, and Indo Jazz. UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador and jazz pianist Herbie Hancock created International Jazz Day to celebrate the global genre, first held in 2012 with events in New York, Paris, and New Orleans. We hope you celebrate by putting on your favorite jazz record, or if you can swing it, visit New Orleans' legendary jazz venue, Preservation Hall, seen in our photo here.","date":"Apr 30, 2023","bsTitle":"A day of swing and celebration","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230430_ExteriorPreservationHall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"4890138ebd4764f1be9a5cd790cf427a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
