Between early November and January, thousands of gray seal pups are born on the shoreline, a little earlier than those on US coasts. The seal moms feed their pups on the beach for three weeks, during which time the pups gain about 4.5 pounds a day. They stay on the beach until they shed their pale fur to make way for a waterproof, mottled gray coat. Then it's time to head to the sea and learn to hunt for themselves.","date":"Nov 21, 2023","bsTitle":"Welcome to the world, pup!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231121_HelloSeal%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bb9fd844a7ebd5bafde91490078b341f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
