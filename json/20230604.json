This famous beach at Wai'ānapanapa State Park on Maui was created when basalt, a dark volcanic rock, was eroded by waves into fine grains, creating a stunning shoreline. You'll find it on Maui's east side, toward the end of the legendary Road to Hana, a scenic 64-mile highway. You can also find black sand shores around the world, from Alaska to Greece, Costa Rica, Italy, Iceland, Indonesia, and New Zealand.","date":"Jun 4, 2023","bsTitle":"Maui's volcanic shores","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230604_MauiBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6d4c6597b1aae68abc7a2ec5fc586dd4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
