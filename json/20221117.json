Muir was instrumental in persuading the government that enjoying nature is the right of every American and that there should be an official national park system. He saw the spectacular beauty of the American West when he walked through the Sierra Nevada in California, and was passionate about preserving the country's national wonders. In 1892, Muir founded the Sierra Club, an environmental organization that protects wild lands to this day.","date":"Nov 17, 2022","bsTitle":"Take a hike!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221117_McKenzieRiverTrail%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"361188627c19c1c09d80f14a7d19cb17","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
