That's because you'd have two reasons to celebrate—the park turns 88 today. These misty peaks and valleys along the border between Tennessee and North Carolina were established as a national park on this day in 1934. All these years later, it may not be the most famous national park in the US, but it is by far the most popular. With more than 14 million visitors per year, it draws more people than the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and Yosemite combined.","date":"Jun 15, 2022","bsTitle":"The top of Tennessee","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220615_ClingmansDome%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1b0b82d7af56baf5db1585172c4401ac","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
