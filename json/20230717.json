Its first stones are thought to have been laid in the early 13th century by the Anglo-Norman de Lacy family, but the O'Reilly clan took possession of the area in 1233 and completed the castle's construction. They retained control of Cloughoughter Castle for centuries, but by 1653, it had been bombed and abandoned. Since then, it has been in ruins, resplendent in a sort of tattered grandeur. It can only be visited by boat but, as a symbol of Ireland's medieval heritage, it is a must-see for history and castle enthusiasts alike.","date":"Jul 17, 2023","bsTitle":"No moat required","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230717_CavanCastle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7e00ee2c9f2ca85853ffc870026f7a03","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
