It lends liveliness and character to the world around us, but we can also use it strategically to convey particular tones and messages. Blue creates a sense of tranquility, purple gives a sense of luxury, and red can express passion or danger. On International Color Day, organizations around the world meet to discuss research and share knowledge about color theory and its use in the fields of industry, arts, science, and design. As you go about your day, stop and take in the colors around you and think about why they were chosen and how they make you feel. It might just make you consider how you use color in your own life.","date":"Mar 21, 2023","bsTitle":"What's your favorite color?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230321_ColourDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"12f6fa4f084966a8be7969032162d7a1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
