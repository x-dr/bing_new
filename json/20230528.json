They are carved into the side of a valley near the town of Ubud and use the traditional Subak irrigation system, which dates back to the 9th century. Bali's rivers and streams provide year-round water for its crops but here people work hand-in-hand with nature, and a network of irrigation channels distribute water to each paddy field. They carefully tend rice plants during the growing season, as generations have done before them, before harvesting and distributing the rice between the community. The Subak system is so important in Balinese culture, it has been recognised by UNESCO. These terraces offer visitors panoramic views over the surrounding rice fields and lush landscape, as well as a picturesque example of people living in harmony with nature.","date":"May 28, 2023","bsTitle":"Farming in harmony with nature","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230528_TegallalangTerrace%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"694aa9e0a3a9245588650fbdda169968","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
