Surrounded by the Indian Ocean, this sand bar is a popular destination with tourists looking to soak up the sun's rays on its white sands. Plentiful marine life here creates a vibrant underwater world that is perfect for snorkeling. The islands of Tanzania are home to an array of wildlife like the Pemba scops owl and the African fish eagle. To the north of Nakupenda, there is a giant tortoise sanctuary on Changuu Island, while their sea turtle cousins swim in the surrounding waters.","date":"Jul 12, 2023","bsTitle":"The world's most exclusive beach?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230712_NakupendaBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"189242cddb89c5c38d0e78bb4b0050dc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
