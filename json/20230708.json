Cooper Memorial Chapel in Arkansas","copyrightonly":"© Eddie Brady/Getty Images","desc":"The Mildred B. Cooper Memorial Chapel in Bella Vista, Arkansas, is one of the most charming buildings in the country. Constructed in 1988 and named for a beloved community member whose husband commissioned it, this chapel was designed by E. Fay Jones, an architect known for his wooden creations. Its unique design seamlessly blends modernist principles with nature's splendor, resulting in a harmonious space which blends with its natural setting. Surrounded by lush trees, with sunlight filtering in through the huge glass windows, the chapel serves as a perfect sanctuary for contemplation and prayer. It also stands as a powerful testament to the ability of architecture to inspire and uplift the human spirit.","date":"Jul 8, 2023","bsTitle":"Sanctuary among the trees","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230708_CooperChapel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e8019489bf4e259464a9d09dfc594c7d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
