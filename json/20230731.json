This corridor, halfway up a 150-foot cliff, was carved by erosion and has offered shelter to various dwellers over different periods. Long before European settlers arrived, the area's Native American people are believed to have used Rock House as a refuge. Small recesses in the rock walls are thought to have been used as baking ovens, while troughs gouged in the cave's floor helped them to collect water. The walls of Rock House have seven window-like openings, allowing sunlight to filter through, casting beautiful patterns inside the cave and offering cliffside views over the trees for generations of Rock House dwellers.","date":"Jul 31, 2023","bsTitle":"Home of stone","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230731_RockHouse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"df74f6f7270ed6ca3a200820df50f0f3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
