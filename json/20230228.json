Just 800 people get to call Atrani home, the rest of us can only hope to visit one of the country's smallest towns, walking its narrow roads as we admire the small houses perched above the beach. The traditional fishing village is part of the Costiera Amalfitana UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it has kept its traditional characteristics alive. It is a perfect Mediterranean getaway to soak up the sun and enjoy local seafood at a waterfront cafe.","date":"Feb 28, 2023","bsTitle":"Allure of the Amalfi Coast","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230228_AtraniAmalfi%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"207edef1d207094374bef6ff24c14f3f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
