Its feathers are not red but brambly brown and gray throughout the winter, when it lives a low-key, quiet life in salt water along North American and European coasts. But just before it migrates to a northerly lake, pond, or swamp for breeding season, the plumage around the grebe's throat turns a distinctive rust-red. Both males and females undergo the plumage change.","date":"Aug 3, 2022","bsTitle":"You might be a red-necked grebe if…","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220803_RedneckedGrebe%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0bae4694641f2138d01cfee237f152ce","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
