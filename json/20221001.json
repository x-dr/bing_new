First things first: Don't call it 'falls' because then someone may think you were in Utah where another waterfall bears the surprisingly similar name, Bridal Veil Falls. Bridalveil, as seen in the photo, is often the first waterfall visitors to Yosemite encounter. It plunges 617 feet and flows year-round, fed with water from Ostrander Lake nearly 10 miles away. When the flow is light, brisk winds blow the water sideways. That's why the Ahwahneechee Native Americans, who have lived in the Yosemite Valley for centuries, traditionally called the waterfall Pohono, or 'Spirit of the Puffing Wind.'","date":"Oct 1, 2022","bsTitle":"Spirit of the Puffing Wind","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221001_BridalVeilFalls%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3094889c2d386ce9ec13da425d8fd91b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
