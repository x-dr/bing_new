Wooden huts open their doors to visitors, and a nostalgic cable car ride, each cabin adorned with twinkling fairy lights, travels above snow-covered slopes. During the 18th century, the valley became famous for its production of intricately carved wooden figurines, initially made to decorate Catholic churches. Among those creations, the peg wooden doll emerged as one of Val Gardena's best-known products and is still being produced today.","date":"Dec 20, 2023","bsTitle":"Lights of the Dolomites","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231220_ValGardenaItaly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3db1577fb7bd3b015ff1b51317282f26","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
