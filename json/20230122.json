Those born under the sign of the rabbit are believed to be ingenious, sweet, happy, quiet, and persistent. Famous rabbits include Albert Einstein, Frank Sinatra, Lionel Messi, and Ingrid Bergman. The Lunar New Year celebration starts with the first new moon in January and goes for the next 15 days, until the year's first full moon lights up the night sky. Historically it has been an occasion for feasting and honoring deities as well as ancestors. We're doing our part by sharing this lovely winter image of a mountain hare in Derbyshire, England.","date":"Jan 22, 2023","bsTitle":"Hop into Lunar New Year","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230122_YearRabbit%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5716f9d3fcea080933bcdd5d94bdce0a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
