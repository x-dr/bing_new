They are not just a stunning addition to the landscape—they are crucial for the survival of the rare Karner blue butterfly. The larvae of the short-lived species will only feed on wild blue lupines, crawling up their stems to eat new leaves when they hatch. Once widespread across much of eastern North America, wild lupines have been in decline since the Industrial Revolution and human development has reduced their range. This has had a knock-on effect on the butterflies, which are now an endangered species. Conservation efforts have focused on replanting areas of wild blue lupines to boost butterfly numbers.","date":"May 12, 2023","bsTitle":"A butterfly's best friend","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230512_WildLupine%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e612bebc2aa3e2c5de8ec04ce65d36fd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
