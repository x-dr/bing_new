Here, you'll find whales, dolphins, turtles, sharks, dugongs, and algae, all living together in a delicate ecosystem that relies on the coral reef. Sadly, climate change and pollution threaten this iconic site, the largest reef in the world. On June 1, we observe World Reef Awareness Day to remind people of the importance of safeguarding coral reefs, which provide food and shelter for about 25% of all marine life, to maintain the balance of nature.","date":"Jun 1, 2023","bsTitle":"Blue as far as the eye can see","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230601_ReefAwareness%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e46daa34f22f8f6500d9825907854be5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
