The military efforts of women, less visible than those of men, are commemorated by the Vietnam Women's Memorial, featured today on Veterans Day. While Memorial Day honors those who died during military service, Veterans Day recognizes the service of all veterans, whether or not they served during a war. Veterans Day, a federal holiday, was originally known as Armistice Day and coincides with the anniversary of the end of World War I. For this reason, other countries also observe today as a holiday.","date":"Nov 11, 2022","bsTitle":"Honoring those who served","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221111_WomensMemorialMall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"4601202b69dedb4fa93c2c24855b7b3e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
