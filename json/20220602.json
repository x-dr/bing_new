For Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee—she's been monarch for an amazing 70 years—a slew of events are planned, hitting all the notes from pomp and ceremony to picnics on the village green. Of course, the Trooping of the Colour will take center stage today as the official birthday parade, with 1,400 soldiers in full military regalia, 200 horses, and 400 military band musicians. The royal family will watch the parade and then turn their gaze to the skies as the Royal Air Force flies past. The rest of the jubilee week will include a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, a live concert here at Buckingham Palace, and a special pageant featuring people from throughout Britain.","date":"Jun 2, 2022","bsTitle":"Good place for a party","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220602_QueenJubilee%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c1605b741da3a892398c149eb35f9250","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
