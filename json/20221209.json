The cow and calf in our photo belong to Norway's only herd of muskoxen, and you can visit them in Dovre-Sunndalsfjella National Park. If you feel like roaming by yourself, follow the signposted Musk Ox Trail; just be aware that the massive animals are known to attack if they feel threatened, so give them a wide berth. That sound too scary? Jump on a park safari with an experienced guide who can keep you safe and help you see the muskox in all its hairy glory.","date":"Dec 9, 2022","bsTitle":"What are these ancient animals?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221209_NorwayMuskox%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ff376046f1f37b0634ab379b7b9a966d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
