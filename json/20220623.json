Truth is, not much is known about the 16th-century construction of this bridge in what is now known as Bosnia and Herzegovina. All that remains in historical records are memories and legends and the name of the bridge's builder, Mimar Hayruddin. He was charged by Suleiman the Magnificent to build an unprecedentedly wide arch, and threatened with death if the structure failed. Hayruddin is said to have been so unsure of his creation that he made funeral preparations before the scaffolding was removed.","date":"Jun 23, 2022","bsTitle":"The 'Old Bridge,' reborn","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220623_MostarBridge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a66ecdbd53315f5f0c3549042dc99d70","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
