Known as noctilucent, or 'night-shining,' clouds, they're the highest clouds in our sky and are only visible during summer. They're made up of icy dust glowing at the edge of space, roughly 50 miles above the planet's surface. The trick to seeing them is to gaze up into the sky at twilight, when sunlight is not reaching the Earth's surface, but is still shining through the high-altitude noctilucent clouds. These clouds occur more often at high latitudes but have been seen lower than 50° north and south.","date":"Jul 31, 2022","bsTitle":"Noctilucent clouds","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220731_NoctilucentClouds%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0773b8d5d86f319b16b02d6668361473","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
