Surrounded by lush greenery and the Togakushi Mountain Range in Nagano Prefecture, Kagami-ike emerges from the morning mists to create an enchanting spectacle. During the cherry blossom season, visitors walk among sakura petals that float along the breeze while, in autumn, they can enjoy its surrounding orange and yellow foliage. This secluded spot is a wonderfully peaceful place for mindful meditation and self-reflection.","date":"Aug 6, 2023","bsTitle":"A peaceful place for self-reflection","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230806_NaganoPond%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d65d96e12ee697471250aa345e3ca4e9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
