Despite appearances and the season, there's nothing paranormal about a Brocken spectre. It's the magnified shadow of an observer cast in midair upon a cloud opposite a strong light source. Brocken spectres are rare but climb a mountain at dawn up to the misty slopes and you may be fortunate enough to witness the effect. The spectre, also known as a Brocken bow, mountain spectre, or spectre of the Brocken, can appear anywhere in which conditions are right—like here in the Balkans of Bulgaria. But it's the thick fogs of the Brocken, a peak in the Harz Mountains in Germany, from which the phenomenon draws its name.","date":"Oct 26, 2022","bsTitle":"A ghost on the mountain","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221026_BrockenSpecter%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"15f55b00e0b5db258f90efb5f8c826e3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
