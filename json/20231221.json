This region is home to the villages of Uffing and Schöffau, on the shores of Staffelsee lake, and is often covered in mist and snow, creating an ethereal ambience. A winter chill is to be expected today, on the shortest day of the year. Typically falling on December 21, the solstice marks the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
