They are burrowing owls, which means that they live on the ground or under it. In fact, they often take advantage of the hard work of tunnelers such as prairie dogs or gophers by building their nests in the burrows they dug and abandoned. Think of burrowing owls as squatters of the avian world. You'll find these 7½- to 11-inch birds in North and South America, especially in grasslands, farming areas, or dry expanses with vegetation that is close to the ground.","date":"Aug 22, 2022","bsTitle":"Rebels of the owl world","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220822_TenderMoment%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4d13e2ef27797235ae9bedaee6f355af","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
