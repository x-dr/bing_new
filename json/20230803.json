Here in Slovenia’s Triglav National Park, these crystal-clear waters are the source of the Sava Dolinka, which runs into the country’s longest river, the Sava. Peer closely at the lakebed and you will see tiny springs bubbling up beneath the water's surface. These spring waters never freeze as underground water temperatures stay around 41 degrees Fahrenheit, enough to keep flowing through harsh winters in this alpine region.","date":"Aug 3, 2023","bsTitle":"A lake that never freezes","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230803_ZelenciSprings%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3e6e0ed84cb0130ccac8eb7344d07fed","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
