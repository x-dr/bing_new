But the sighs that the name refers to aren't from staring into your darling's eyes. The enclosed bridge, completed in 1600, connects the Prigioni Nuove (New Prison) to the interrogation rooms in the Doge's Palace, and it is said that a prisoner's last look at beautiful Venice would be from that bridge. And that's reason enough to sigh indeed.","date":"Oct 27, 2022","bsTitle":"A kiss and a sigh","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221027_BridgeofSighs%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c8a0d8496542d5214fe064b6dc6f225e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
