While Abraham Lincoln's final Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 freed slaves in Confederate states, certain areas did not abolish slavery until months after Confederate forces surrendered. Texas issued an order on June 19, 1865, that 'all slaves are free.' This act was the origin of Juneteenth, which combines the words June and nineteenth. However, slavery did not fully end in the US until the 13th Amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865.","date":"Jun 19, 2023","bsTitle":"Happy Juneteenth!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230619_SanFranHall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"510d79408d89b36bcfea98929fbec5b0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
