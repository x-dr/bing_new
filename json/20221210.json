The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia is the largest salt flat in the world at about 4,000 square miles. The salt flat is the remains of an ancient lake that evaporated long ago leaving behind a thick mineral crust that is both a source of edible salt and a critical breeding ground for, of all things, flamingos. But for a battery-hungry world, the greatest riches might lie below the crust—a vast brine rich in lithium.","date":"Dec 10, 2022","bsTitle":"When just a pinch of salt won't do","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221210_SaltDesert%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"70fd98bf37c739e363f340845635c67f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
