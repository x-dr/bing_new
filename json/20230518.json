It was built to house Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s vast art collection, which includes the largest collection of sculptures by Auguste Rodin outside France. The building, designed by Fernando Romero, is a sculpture in itself. Covered in 16,000 hexagonal aluminum plates, the windowless facade looks stunning and helps protect the artwork inside from intense sunlight. It is one of many eye-catching museum buildings worldwide which attract interest both for their collections and for their creative design.","date":"May 18, 2023","bsTitle":"International Museum Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230518_MuseoSoumaya%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"437f6e58c3e315d328c0206515578bdf","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
