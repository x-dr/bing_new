Infinity Day is held on the eighth day of the eighth month, a nod to the symbol's likeness to a sideways figure-of-eight. Established in 1987 by a New York-based philosopher, Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo, the day celebrates freedom of thinking in its various forms, from philosophy through the arts and sciences. The symbol itself has a much longer history. English mathematician John Wallis is credited with introducing it as a mathematical symbol in 1655. The philosophical concept of infinity dates back at least as far as ancient Greece.","date":"Aug 8, 2023","bsTitle":"To the infinite and back","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230808_InfinityTaipei%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6961aeffa7e331059b8ed94f9d8be2ef","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
