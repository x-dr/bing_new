Fallow deer are native to Europe and parts of Asia and are a common sight in England, where they were introduced by the Normans in the 11th century. During the autumn rutting season, mothers stay close to their young while the males, which have broad palmate antlers, spar to establish their dominance. Our homepage doe and fawn are pictured in 850-acre Bradgate Park in Leicestershire, a medieval deer park set within woodlands and a beautiful landscape in England's East Midlands region.","date":"Nov 26, 2023","bsTitle":"Who stepped on a twig?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231126_BradgateFallow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1f8c0c3c1d3fb2fcf4b519b83ce94eba","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
