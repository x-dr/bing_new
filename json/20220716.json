First the basics: We're in South Carolina looking at a beautiful American goldfinch perched atop a sunflower. While the matching color scheme makes for a great photo, it's likely this little bird has stopped for a meal. American goldfinches are among the strictest vegetarians in the bird world, preferring grains and seeds, especially sunflower seeds. That's why it's not uncommon to see them in neighborhoods with well-stocked bird feeders. In fact, human activity has generally benefited American goldfinches overall. The birds thrive in areas where forests have been removed—they prefer open meadows or fields covered in weeds.","date":"Jul 16, 2022","bsTitle":"The 'potato chip bird'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220716_AmericanGoldfinch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4575d50dbfecf593ba6c67e28060a350","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
