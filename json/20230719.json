This oasis, named for its unusual shape, has been a vital water source here for centuries. The lake is thought to have formed in a valley carved by wind and been fed by an underground spring. It sits amid Dunhuang's 'singing' sand dunes, which make a noise when the wind blows. The sand dunes also help stop the lake from being swallowed by sand and conservation efforts have ensured that it doesn't dry out. Visitors enjoy boating on the lake, camel rides through the surrounding dunes, and seeing ancient Buddhist art and murals in the nearby Mogao Caves.","date":"Jul 19, 2023","bsTitle":"This oasis is no mirage","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230719_CrescentLake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"df864ad43466cf2fccca5f0e902a9338","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
