Regarded by some as the only truly pure wild horse today, it is easily recognized by its pale yellowish-brown coat, a short, stiff mane, and short legs. The Przewalski's horse, also called the 'takhi' in Mongolia, was once extinct in the wild but has been successfully reintroduced through conservation efforts in the 1990s. An interesting fact about these horses is that they have 66 chromosomes, compared with 64 in domestic horses. Remarkably, Przewalski's horses can mate with domestic horses to produce hybrids. These hybrids have 65 chromosomes and can breed and have their own offspring.","date":"Sep 14, 2023","bsTitle":"Just two pals horsin' around","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230914_MongoliaHorses%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e59c21f32f8ea5e749ef6996a8b0252f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
