In this case, dinner will be served in Torres del Paine National Park in the Patagonia region of Chile, the sprawling park recognized as one of the most famous places in the world to watch and photograph wild pumas. While tourists will sometimes see the big cats on their own, trained guides take visitors on hikes or all-terrain vehicle tours to look for the stealthy pumas. The wild cats have been officially protected for the last few years, bolstering their population, and there are abundant guanacos in the Patagonian steppes, which also helps.","date":"Sep 16, 2022","bsTitle":"Nimble and stealthy","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220916_PianePuma%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bccc57610ef5db3d8b7a478de8b0c2b8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
