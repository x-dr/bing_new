This winter dusting of Istanbul, Türkiye's largest city, brings into sharper focus the lines of Rumelihisarı in the center of our image. The structure, also known as Rumeli Fortress, was built in the 15th century by an Ottoman sultan as a way to choke naval traffic through the narrow Bosporus Strait. The Bosporus connects the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea, separating Istanbul into what are often referred to as its 'European side' and 'Asian side.' Today, the fortress isn't used to fire upon ships but serves as a museum and concert venue. While the place has changed over the centuries, the killer view hasn't.","date":"Jan 12, 2023","bsTitle":"Where two continents meet","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230112_RumeliHisari%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0dd5a93c1f1f4289eacebe2cf58ae973","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
