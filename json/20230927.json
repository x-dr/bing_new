Built between 1900 and 1902 by the German industrialist Friedrich Alfred Krupp, the footpath connects the town of Capri to Marina Piccola beach, and  allowed Krupp to access his properties. The pathway's intricate layout, with its sharp turns and steep inclines, was an engineering marvel of its time. Via Krupp's panoramic vistas of the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Faraglioni rock formations, and the lush landscape of the island have drawn admiration for generations. Due to concerns over preservation and safety, because of falling rocks, the pathway has faced intermittent closures, though it reopened in June this year for the first time in nine years.","date":"Sep 27, 2023","bsTitle":"Slow and steady climbs the cliff","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230927_CapriKrupp%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2b1cf866e9c555295120a9cae549ad96","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
