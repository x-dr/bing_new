The first pride parades took to the streets in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles in June 1970, in remembrance of the Stonewall Uprising in Greenwich Village, New York City, the previous year. In the early hours of June 28, 1969, police dragged staff and patrons from the Stonewall Inn bar, a gay venue, sparking six days of protests. Now pride parades and events are celebrated each June in most parts of the world—New York City's is still one of the largest pride celebrations. In 1999, President Bill Clinton gave Pride Month national recognition by declaring June 'Gay & Lesbian Pride Month.'","date":"Jun 26, 2022","bsTitle":"Flying the flag for Pride","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220626_Pride2022%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b2026e83747abcca033b51344916292c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
