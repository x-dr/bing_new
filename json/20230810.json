Lions lounge in lordly leisure and hunt with ferocious focus on grasslands and plains. When they're not hunting, these majestic creatures nap, wrestle, and groom each other. But in an instant, they're chasing down a hapless gazelle or a hippopotamus that's wandered too far from the safety of its river. Like the opening song of 'The Lion King' movie says, it's the circle of life. World Lion Day is our opportunity to (ahem) lionize these regal beasts and raise awareness of threats to their well-being like poaching, habitat destruction, and other human-lion conflicts.","date":"Aug 10, 2023","bsTitle":"'King of the jungle'?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230810_WorldLionDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b8b0c17ef1ff88005520e90b250a7905","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
