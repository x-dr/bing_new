January 21 is Squirrel Awareness Day, honoring these furry seed distributors. Today's homepage star is the Eurasian red squirrel, whose striking reddish-brown coat, white underbelly, and bushy tail are a familiar sight in several countries. These squirrels are not only exceptional jumpers—capable of leaping up to 6 feet in one jump—they can even swim to search for food. They gather nuts and acorns in the autumn and hide them, to see them through the winter months. If you spot fuzzy-tailed squirrels frolicking in your backyard, they might also appreciate a feeding station stocked with treats such as raspberries or crab apples.","date":"Jan 21, 2024","bsTitle":"Tales from the treetops","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240121_SquirrelNetherlands%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"026d2dcdb3631f0f0c76a0e7325f6b68","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
