To get to it, visitors need to take a boat toward the mouth of Banderas Bay at the base of the Marietas Islands. Once there, they swim through a tunnel at low tide to reach the beach. The walls hide a sandy cove, where the turquoise waters contrast with flora-laden cliffs that perfectly frame the blue sky overhead. Playa del Amor (Lovers' Beach) is popular among tourists, but the number of visitors is limited to preserve its natural beauty and ecosystem.","date":"May 30, 2023","bsTitle":"Secluded sands in Mexico","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230530_HiddenBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"798025df06879498773b67e72de87d5e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
