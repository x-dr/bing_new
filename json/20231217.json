Large groups wander across the northern US and Canada in search of food, swooping on trees and shrubs to find fruit. In winter, they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper, and rowan berries. As spring casts its spell, these nomads settle down for the breeding season. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying two to six bluish-gray eggs, and hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents. One can easily spot these sociable birds, as they often gather in chirpy flocks in North America and Eurasia.","date":"Dec 17, 2023","bsTitle":"Feathered fashionistas","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231217_WinterWaxwings%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c17c4631dbf7e1f7e9e915b429563445","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
