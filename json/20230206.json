Waitangi Day is New Zealand's national day, established to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on February 6, 1840. The document was signed by representatives of the British Crown and some 500 Māori chiefs to establish British law on the islands. The treaty also created the framework for political relations between New Zealand's government and the Indigenous Māori people. It's considered New Zealand's founding document and a cornerstone in the country's history.","date":"Feb 6, 2023","bsTitle":"Where fiords meet forests","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230206_WaitangiFjordlandNP%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3c36f51ab02a138ee01c7fe5098cb30c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
