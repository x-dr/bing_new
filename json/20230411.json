This winsome waterfall became popular in recent years after several renowned photographers snapped it following its discovery in 2006. Waterfalls around the world draw our attention and inspire emotions (and even themes for pop songs). In contrast to the serene, burbling Mossy Grotto Falls, Angel Falls in Venezuela is the tallest in the world, where water plunges 2,648 feet before reaching the ground. This roaring wonder is awe-inspiring and one of the top tourist-draws in the country. If you need a moment of reflection, we recommend searching for the nearest waterfall and taking a trip to connect with nature.","date":"Apr 11, 2023","bsTitle":"Where is this hidden waterfall?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230411_MossyGrottoFalls%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4b5bf3c89f94ff33a5337c5e45342854","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
