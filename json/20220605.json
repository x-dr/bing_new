This is Rapadalen (Rapa Valley), a 22-mile-long valley in Sarek National Park in the pristine mountains of northern Sweden. Surrounded by steep mountains, the Rapa Valley is considered one of Europe's most enchanting landscapes. The remote, high-alpine region is beautiful to be sure, but it's only recommended for experienced and well-equipped hikers. The weather is severe and unpredictable, and there are no accommodations available for tourists.","date":"Jun 5, 2022","bsTitle":"'Only One Earth'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220605_RapadalenSNP%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"959f49a155f1fb131b446df3d67eb5e1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
