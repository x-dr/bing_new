Made entirely from stone blocks, it was built in the 3rd century CE, when this area was Thysdrus, a city of ancient Rome. Once capable of seating up to 35,000 spectators, it is the largest colosseum in North Africa and one of the largest in the world. A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979, it is one of the best-preserved Roman amphitheatres, almost equal in grandeur to the Colosseum in Rome.","date":"Aug 22, 2023","bsTitle":"A 'standing ovation' to Roman architecture","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230822_TunisiaAmphitheatre%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"303e4f1d1f1984e440d5cb71eccb80b3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
