The Arashiyama Bamboo Grove on the outskirts of Kyoto is surrounded by temples and shrines along the Katsura River. Rising as a manicured oasis of stories-high bamboo, the grove seems to turn the world green. The former villas and temples of the old noble class are located near the Arashiyama Grove, and its single 500-yard path is usually filled with visitors wielding cameras and selfie sticks, making this serene view a rare one.","date":"Sep 18, 2022","bsTitle":"A grove glows green","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220918_ArashiyamaBamboo%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b8655f0d31276fb75b45ca0b67b97056","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
