It was designed by architect Cecil Brewer ahead of the opening of an in-store art gallery. While the gallery no longer exists, the Cecil Brewer Staircase remains a popular part of the store's heritage, particularly with photographers looking to capture a little London glamour. The lights at the outer edge of the stairs were added after World War II, and the elegant chandelier cascading from top to bottom was installed in 2013. If you visit, keep an eye out for a bronze cat on a windowsill overlooking the stairs, the store's not-for-sale official mascot.","date":"Mar 25, 2023","bsTitle":"Winding down in style","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230325_CecilBrewerStaircase%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b2e105c30cd7d033df22cb69f615bfd8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
