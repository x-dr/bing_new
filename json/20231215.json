Rovaniemi is a gateway to the Arctic Circle and a destination where reality and folklore merge. Visitors can watch the Northern Lights, explore the Arctic wilderness, and experience the magic of Christmas at various Santa-themed attractions, including SantaPark, an underground theme park designed to emulate the cavern home of the man himself, and the Santa Claus Village. The entrance to SantaPark, lit by glowing lights, is pictured on our homepage today. Other attractions in Rovaniemi include a hotel built from snow and ice, a popular ski resort, and horse sleigh rides around a vast frozen lake.","date":"Dec 15, 2023","bsTitle":"Santa's playground","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231215_SantaPark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e36a7d1e6e83435cf08b469071a6ef98","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
