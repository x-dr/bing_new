For Computer Science Education Week, we celebrate information systems and their power to connect the world, 24 hours a day. Where better to mark the occasion than the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN—birthplace of the World Wide Web? The 89-foot ball seen on today’s homepage is CERN's Globe of Science and Innovation in Switzerland, in which visitors can learn more about the organization's research work on particle physics. Quiet observers can wander around exhibitions and follow guided tours, and curious minds can take part in lab workshops and science shows for a first-hand experience.","date":"Dec 6, 2023","bsTitle":"A global code for the future","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231206_CERNCenter%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"d1007c6ddb8caaa76ba7103150680160","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
