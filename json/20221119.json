Flowing through Zion National Park (which turns 103 today!), the Virgin River is home to unique plants and animals that aren't found anywhere else, due to the unique intersection of biomes found where the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert all meet. Without the water of the Virgin River system, creatures like the woundfin minnow, one of rarest species on the planet, couldn't exist.","date":"Nov 19, 2022","bsTitle":"103 years of Zion","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221119_ZNPVR%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8ab9b866699db5f67a5b74a9dc1298c5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
