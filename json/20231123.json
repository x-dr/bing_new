Early English settlers had plenty to be thankful for, whether surviving the long voyage to America or the first harsh winters. Written records tell of an early thanksgiving shared between Plymouth Pilgrims and Wampanoag Native Americans, who provided a harvest of corn, deer, and turkey. There were many early days of thanksgiving, but an official, national celebration was proclaimed by George Washington in 1789, and has been a part of our holiday season ever since. Today, we wish you good company and plenty of things to be thankful for.
