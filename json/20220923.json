Golden jellyfish are a subspecies unique to this small lake, on this small island—they're found nowhere else on the planet. Millions of teacup-sized golden jellies inhabit the lake, following the sunlight that nourishes them. Symbiotic algae live inside the jellyfish and provide their hosts with energy as a byproduct of photosynthesis. The more sun the jellies get, the more energy they derive from their hitchhikers. The jellies start the day at the east end of the lake and drift westward until dusk, following the arc of the sun.","date":"Sep 23, 2022","bsTitle":"In a world all their own","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220923_GoldenJellyfish%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4952780dc8b20d4a66e4e528667bae76","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
