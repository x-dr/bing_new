The salt mines here are thought to be among the oldest in the world and were once the backbone of Hallstatt's economy. Today they're a popular tourist attraction—this little village draws in so many visitors that it is considered an area of over-tourism. Hallstatt has sought to limit the number of people who can visit each day.","date":"Dec 13, 2022","bsTitle":"A city so nice they made it twice","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221213_InstagramHallstatt%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f8ed07ef542aa810ffdd93a840cbfb69","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
