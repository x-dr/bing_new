Prayer flags come in five repeating colors representing different elements in nature, blue for the sky, white for air, red for fire, green for water, and yellow for earth. The fluttering fabrics, inscribed with spiritual scripts, are usually raised during times of prosperity, such as on Bhutan's Nyinlong, their traditional day of solstice, which takes place today. As the flags fade over time, adherents believe this signifies that the prayers have been heard and are being carried away by the wind, infusing the surrounding area with positivity and spirituality.","date":"Jan 2, 2024","bsTitle":"Make your own rainbow","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240102_BhutanSolstice%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5f6ee4b7d829062fc91b9d79b8e26a31","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
