Meaning 'jug' in the language of the ancient Amazigh people (aka Berbers), Tafilalet was named for the pottery jars they filled with water from underground springs. After the first permanent settlement of the region, Sijilmassa, was founded in 757 CE, Tafilalet became a stopping point for caravans traveling from the Niger River to Tangier on the northern tip of Morocco and the gateway to Europe.","date":"Jun 28, 2022","bsTitle":"An oasis in a sea of sand","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220628_TafilaletOasis%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a3fda175506a8b06d910349706a8ce2a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
