The star of the show? The tiny Bled Island, which beckons with the promise of legends and 'rowmance.' Make your way there on a traditional, flat-bottomed pletna boat, piloted by oarsmen whose skills have been handed down through generations since 1740. The island is home to the 17th-century Assumption of Mary Church, with its special bell that, legend says, will make wishes come true. If you look to the shore directly above the island in our image, you can spot Bled Castle overlooking the lake's expanse. The castle—one of the oldest in Slovenia—is positioned on a precipice above the town of Bled on the northwestern shore of the lake.","date":"Oct 1, 2023","bsTitle":"Awake to the lake","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231001_LakeBledSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5fd5d56e00490e9e1faa998dc10cfbad","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
