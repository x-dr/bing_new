In the Northern Hemisphere, this is called the spring or vernal equinox, and it marks the astronomical exit of winter into the brighter, warmer springtime. From now on, we can enjoy days that are longer than nights. And a sharp eye might spot a flowering crocus, like the ones in today's image, among the first flowers to bloom every year.","date":"Mar 20, 2023","bsTitle":"Hello spring!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230320_PurpleCrocus%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"10798feba176443b039b98735bb4db53","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
