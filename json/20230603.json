Each year, National Trails Day brings together nature lovers, government agencies, and businesses to preserve hiking trails for everyone to enjoy. Looking for a stunning spot to stretch your legs? We suggest South Kaibab Trail in the Grand Canyon, seen here. The trail starts with a series of switchbacks known as 'The Chimney,' which leads to a steep, narrow descent—prepare for an invigorating workout! All that hard work will pay off though—fresh air and exertion can boost your mood, improve sleep, and reduce the risk of heart disease. Not to mention the panoramic views you can enjoy from the trail's scenic viewpoints.","date":"Jun 3, 2023","bsTitle":"A glimpse of the grandest of canyons","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230603_SouthKaibabTrail%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e237c5e80e74c396d5d6c37480d546b4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
