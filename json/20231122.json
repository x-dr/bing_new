The park, established in 1929, encompasses lakes, the Snake River, and the Teton Range, famed for its series of sharp, jagged peaks. Bring your binoculars with you, and if it's summertime, be on the lookout for pronghorn, which travel about 150 miles to get there from Wyoming's Upper Green River Basin. They aren't the only creatures to visit seasonally; elk and bison are also summer visitors. These migrations play a vital role in the ecosystem of Grand Teton National Park. The animals help disperse seeds and are also food for predators.","date":"Nov 22, 2023","bsTitle":"The quiet beauty of Grand Teton","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231122_SnakeRiverTeton%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fda02c13cd77bf908a7eab483b8049fb","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
