Was it terrifying or an event of wonder? Thankfully, we now know that this celestial cascade is a harmless annual event. The Perseid meteor shower thrills stargazers from mid-July to late August and is due to peak today. The Perseids are caused by Earth passing through debris left behind by the Comet Swift-Tuttle. When the cosmic debris hits our atmosphere, it disintegrates in a colorful, fiery light display. It's a good night to catch the Perseids if you can—the moon is projected to only be 10% illuminated, so the meteors should really stand out against the dark sky.","date":"Aug 13, 2023","bsTitle":"Look up, incoming…","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230813_PerseidsOregon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f90dede42cda6e75a561733e7a6bb8f8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
