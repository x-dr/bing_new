Edale is one of many dales—or wide valleys—of England's Peak District National Park, a picturesque area where heather moorland and rocky gritstone landscapes sit side-by-side with rolling uplands. From here, walkers set out on the hilly and remote Pennine Way, covering 268 miles along England's wildest landscapes up to the Scottish Borders. But if you don't want to hike that far, excellent walking country surrounds the village itself, which lies to the south of the Peak District's highest point, Kinder Scout.","date":"Mar 10, 2023","bsTitle":"Up hill and down dale","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230310_EdaleValley%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ab0124716201330d2af677004f7d4014","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
