The home of Oktoberfest, it also has a worldwide reputation for its beer and its northern region of Franconia, where our picture was taken, is a premier wine destination. This little door leads to an underground cellar near the village of Pünzendorf, and its naturally low temperature once made it an ideal place to store the beer and wine the area is famous for. These days, you might be more likely to find bats inside, so perhaps it's better admired from a distance.","date":"Apr 24, 2023","bsTitle":"Beneath the woods","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230424_FranconianWineCellar%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"88e67475910fdf1a3157480c408cece4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
