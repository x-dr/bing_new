It was the summer residence of the ruling Habsburg emperors from the 18th century to 1918, having been redeveloped by Empress Maria Theresa in the 1740s. Complemented by its lush gardens, which house the world's oldest existing public zoo, the palace itself is a gem of Europe's opulent Baroque era. Schönbrunn Palace Park has been open to the public since 1779 and both it and the palace, now under the ownership of the Austrian government, are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This leaf-strewn path offers an escape from the bustling city. So, take a stroll on this enchanting estate and let yourself be transported to centuries past.","date":"Oct 26, 2023","bsTitle":"A leaf stomper's paradise","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231026_ViennaAutumn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4ca8999ada0b4544423210b5c213dd06","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
