The gardens have changed with the times, all while still jealously guarding their history. The site here in the county of Suffolk, in eastern England, was originally home to a powerful Benedictine abbey in medieval times—in fact, 2022 marks the 1,000th anniversary of the storied abbey. You can still visit the abbey ruins and marvel at the 14th-century Great Gate and Norman Tower, which have survived through the ages. Nathaniel Hodson took the original abbey gardens and designed them as a botanical garden in 1831, using the Royal Botanic Gardens in Brussels, with their concentric circles, as his inspiration.","date":"Jul 21, 2022","bsTitle":"Stunning symmetry","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220721_AbbeyGardens%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8fc833d7da873f8cc6e72ff70b7346af","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
