A day to slowly unwind while rocking gently from side to side. These days, hammocks are associated with summer relaxation, but they were originally developed by Central Americans to protect them from dangerous insects and animals. Today the hammock is a traveler's best buddy, made from a variety of materials like fabric, netting, or rope. But where best to hang it?
