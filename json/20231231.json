Tonight is New Year's Eve, time to see out the old year and welcome the new. But how you celebrate depends which country you're in. If you're not in the US watching the Times Square Ball Drop, you might smash crockery in Denmark, eat 12 grapes as the clock strikes midnight in Spain, or hang onions outside your door in Greece. In Thailand, you might watch the fireworks illuminating Phra Nakhon Khiri, or 'holy city hill,' a historical park spread over three peaks overlooking the city of Phetchaburi. Wherever you celebrate, have a great one.
