Founding Father John Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, that he believed the holiday would be celebrated with parades, sports, shows, and illuminations. After 247 years, Americans are keeping those traditions alive, though not on the date that Adams anticipated. The Second Continental Congress voted to approve the independence of the United States of America on July 2, 1776, but formally adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4. That date, enshrined on the Declaration document, became the one we observe today. If you're looking for a grand way to celebrate, journey to New York City for views of their annual fireworks show and the Empire State Building lit up to match in red, white, and blue.","date":"Jul 4, 2023","bsTitle":"Happy Independence Day!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230704_EmpireFourth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"561c8478e3fc592017ce8a14a7489fa7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
