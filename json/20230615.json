The park is famous for its firefly season between May and June when these 'lightning bugs' gather to put on a light show as part of a mating display. Today, we celebrate the anniversary of this magnificent national park, as well as Nature Photography Day. There may be no better subject than the lightning bug to mark the day—as photography is the art of capturing light in lasting images.","date":"Jun 15, 2023","bsTitle":"Twinkle, twinkle, little bugs","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230615_SmokyFireflies%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0f303f862402a99676c87f62812facfe","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
