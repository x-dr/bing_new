It's hard to stay focused though, as the road winds its way through lush surroundings over 64 miles along the northern coast of Maui, from Kahului to Hana. Make a few stops along the way to get the best views of the rainforests and waterfalls that line the route. Popular attractions include the Waikamoi Ridge Trail, the easily accessible Twin Falls, and the black sands of Wai'ānapanapa State Park.","date":"Jan 13, 2024","bsTitle":"Slow down and enjoy the journey!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240113_HanaHighway%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6ff3cd8f20973f310c39c8ece6b9c3fc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
