These brown bears of Katmai National Park sure are, and their efforts won't go unrewarded. Each year, park rangers organize a bracketed tournament to crown one ravenous contender as the fattest bear. Webcams are set up so anyone can join the crowds watching these bears chow down on sockeye salmon, as the fish return to the park to spawn. Once you've witnessed the feast, you can vote for which bear you think should win the title. New generations will bring new competitors, but they have big paw prints to fill. Bears such as Beadnose and 747—each animal has an ID number and several have names—are repeat champions but fat bear Otis reigns supreme, with four titles to his name. This year's Fat Bear Week finishes on Tuesday, October 10.","date":"Oct 7, 2023","bsTitle":"Time for self-serve salmon","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231007_GrizzlyFalls%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a939d02058ddc3cee2c7a6133613249c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
