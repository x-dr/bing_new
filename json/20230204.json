Parks rejected bus driver James F. Blake's order to vacate a seat on a Mongomery bus in favor of a white passenger and was arrested and fined for this act of civil disobedience. Parks then helped lead a boycott of Montgomery buses that lasted for over a year. The year-long protest finally ended when the US Supreme Court ruled that Alabama’s laws enforcing segregation on city buses and other modes of transportation were unconstitutional.","date":"Feb 4, 2023","bsTitle":"Remembering Rosa Parks","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230204_RosaParksBus%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"e5a9d37858c83da34cb5297f75d2b307","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
