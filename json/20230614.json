Perhaps that is fitting, given that the flag itself has changed many times. The first version had 13 stripes and 13 stars to symbolize the original colonies that eventually formed the United States of America. On June 14, we commemorate the flag’s adoption at the Second Continental Congress in 1777. Initially, it was rarely seen beyond military and government buildings and ships, but it became an icon of American identity during the Civil War. Today, the Stars and Stripes will fly at Flag Day parades and ceremonies, as the country celebrates its symbolism and history.","date":"Jun 14, 2023","bsTitle":"Saluting the Stars and Stripes","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230614_FlagDayCapitol%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ef40d9a21e452e4461bf7d7835fdccae","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
