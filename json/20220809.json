It's thought that the cave paintings were made between 13,000 and 9,500 years ago. The archaeological site is known in Spanish as the Cueva de las Manos (Cave of the Hands). It's the largest display of prehistoric handprints in the world, made all those years ago by people holding a hand against the rock wall and blowing pigments through tubes made of bone. Of the 829 black, white, red, and ochre prints, most are of young male hands. One print has six fingers, and only 31 are of right hands.","date":"Aug 9, 2022","bsTitle":"9,000-year-old handprints","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220809_CuevaManos%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"20b7d544668cc713a63a7352a5c092b0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
