The cove is a coastal gem known for its stunning sea stack—a vertical rock formation that resembles a shark's fin. The fin used to be connected to the mudstone cliff that surrounds the beach. Over time, the relentless crashing waves and strong winds slowly eroded the rock formation. Shark Fin Cove is visible from Highway 1, where travelers can stop and look at the expansive Pacific Ocean views.","date":"Aug 24, 2023","bsTitle":"What a fin-tastic view!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230824_SharkFinCove%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4ce67094216b172c1c6e09bba9e101f5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
