Pictured here is the 1,519-foot-high Kirkjufell, a hill often called 'Church Mountain,' as it is said to resemble a steeple. In fact, it is a nunatak, a rock formation that protrudes through an ice sheet or glacier. You might recognize it from the 'Game of Thrones' series, where it featured in a scene set north of the colossal ice wall. When it's not starring on TV, it is popular with photographers thanks to its unusual shape, coastal location, and colors that shift with the seasons. And if you're lucky, and the weather conditions align, Kirkjufell offers a magnificent view of the northern lights.","date":"Dec 27, 2023","bsTitle":"The land of ice and fire","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231227_KirkjufellAurora%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7f1df22b8bb06736af05c7b5303bd889","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
