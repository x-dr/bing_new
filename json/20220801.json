In near constant eruption for the last 40 years, Kīlauea is widely considered the most active volcano in the world and is the main attraction at Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, which was created on this day in 1916. The park, which was designated an International Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site, also includes another active volcano, Mauna Loa, the world's most massive shield volcano, which last erupted in 1984. Together, they are among the most studied volcanoes in the world.","date":"Aug 1, 2022","bsTitle":"The most active volcano in the world","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220801_LavaTube%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f3382c12cc8c1e77484cba98926af138","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
