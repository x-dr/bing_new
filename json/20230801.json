In a bid to scale the tallest peaks and conquer difficult terrain around the world, mountain climbers embark on physically strenuous journeys that demand exceptional training and experience. But the panoramic views and sense of achievement after reaching the summit makes the effort worthwhile. Our image today is that of Denali, North America's highest peak at 20,310 feet, in south-central Alaska. The name 'Denali' means 'the high one' in the native Athabascan language. Four climbers, Walter Harper, Harry Karstens, Robert Tatum, and Hudson Stuck, were the first to set foot on the top of the mountain in 1913.","date":"Aug 1, 2023","bsTitle":"There's no denying the power of Denali","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230801_DenaliClimber%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b0dac9e24b7740d1ee3dfd265b1b0707","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
