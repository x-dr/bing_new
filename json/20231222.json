The Slavic word 'ljub' means 'to love,' and it's right there in the name of Slovenia's capital city, Ljubljana, and the Ljubljanica River that runs through it. This relatively small capital, with a population of just under 300,000, grew up on a trade route connecting the northern Adriatic Sea and the Danube region. While modern buildings skirt the city's periphery, its core preserves historic structures, some of which date back to ancient Rome. The Ljubljana Castle, pictured in the center of today's homepage image, has towered over the city for 900 years. Other sights include the Triple Bridge, the Dragon Bridge, and the historic Old Town. Keep an eye out while you stroll around; you might encounter the city's symbol, the Ljubljana Dragon.","date":"Dec 22, 2023","bsTitle":"Holiday cheer, Slovenian style","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231222_LjubljanaLights%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5ceca20ef8ecebe3e510e3d2b3e87488","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
