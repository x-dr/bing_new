Getting here means a long, strenuous hike, and for much of the year it is covered in snow. But from midsummer through the fall, hikers and climbers arrive here as the larch trees turn golden. The granite peaks and autumnal colors are not the only attractions. The Enchantments boasts more than 700 alpine lakes and ponds, as well as herds of grazing mountain goats that roam this corner of the scenic Alpine Lakes Wilderness.","date":"Oct 16, 2023","bsTitle":"The magic of the Enchantments","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231016_GoldenEnchantments%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ffdc6b621d8c8b0afba6ad6000dbf437","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
