Early settlers, the Phoenicians and Greeks, introduced the first olive trees but the groves in the Serra de Tramuntana range expanded during Spain's Islamic era, between 709 and 1492. Olive oil became a crucial ingredient in culinary traditions on Majorca, the largest of the Balearic Islands. One ancient tree on the island, Can Det, is estimated to be more than 1,100 years old, and is still producing olives.","date":"Nov 13, 2023","bsTitle":"From the tree to the table","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231113_OliveOrchard%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7c7494dc5a3a4131ea77154f0cca9ddf","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
