Known for their clean, calm waters, they are the perfect place for adventure sports such as snorkeling, surfing, and diving. Staghorn and pillar coral are among the species found in coral reefs surrounding the islands, which teem with marine life. The islands are inhabited primarily by Gunas—people indigenous to Guna Yala—who preserve their way of living with vibrant, traditional clothing, thatched-roof huts known as 'bohíos,' and intricate, handcrafted mola textiles.","date":"Jul 28, 2023","bsTitle":"A blue-tiful island","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230728_SanBlasIslands%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1e4a1844d7e2cea74fb7a81045edcd44","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
