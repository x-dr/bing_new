The Met anchors Museum Mile, a stretch of Fifth Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East Side that is home to eight museums. Of these, the Met is the biggest, followed by the Guggenheim. All reside within 22 blocks of one another. Today, the city celebrates these curatorial treasures with the Museum Mile Festival, as museums extend their hours and offer free admission to all visitors. Billed as a mile-long celebration of art and culture, the festival also includes outdoor performances along Fifth Avenue.","date":"Jun 14, 2022","bsTitle":"Visiting the Met","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220614_MuseumMile%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d21fa1db5fa9e422f2b13cadd239e0c3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
