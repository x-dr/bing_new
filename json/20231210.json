Vast sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and occasional oases create a landscape like no other. Although it is the largest hot desert in the world, the Sahara supports drought-resistant plants like acacia and palm trees, and hardy animals such as camels and fennec foxes. Intriguing features include its shifting sand dunes, pictured in today's image, some of which are over 500 feet high. Ancient rock art and fossils have also been discovered here, providing insights into early civilizations and prehistoric creatures. Sandstorms are common, shaping the ever-changing scenery and adding to the mystique of this natural wonder.","date":"Dec 10, 2023","bsTitle":"Each day a different dune","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231210_SaharaDunes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"65b640319660feca3e45ae7ab6c82429","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
