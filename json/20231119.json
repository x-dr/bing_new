This occasionally ice-covered, vast area of wetlands, forests, and rivers is the largest natural reserve in Estonia. From the majestic white-tailed eagle to the elusive black stork, more than 200 bird species can be found here. The landscape is a tapestry of aquatic forests: still water, bog, and floodplain forests. Winding trails and boardwalks invite explorers to craft their own adventures.","date":"Nov 19, 2023","bsTitle":"Tread carefully!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231119_FrozenBog%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1b16cd545085096c8dbef9a642eaf605","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
