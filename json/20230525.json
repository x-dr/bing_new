It is situated on the coast of Streymoy in the remote Faroe Islands, which sit about halfway between Iceland and Scotland in the North Atlantic. Home to these iconic houses with turf roofs and a tiny population—estimates vary between 8 and 30—it is said that there are more waterfalls in Saksun, than houses.","date":"May 25, 2023","bsTitle":"Where the grass is greener","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230525_SaksunFaroe%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f43ffbb3be42d4683b4e4c6ffa51bf35","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
