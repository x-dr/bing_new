The longest of them, pictured here, is the Storseisundet Bridge. This bridge, surrounded by ample natural beauty, was tough to build. It took six years, and during construction workers were pelted by the region's unpredictable weather, including 12 hurricanes. It opened in 1989 and remains a popular visitor attraction. With its dramatic curve and sudden incline, Storseisundet Bridge creates the illusion of suddenly disappearing into the ocean, making drivers skip a heartbeat. Its construction showcases the brilliance of Norwegian engineering, blending seamlessly with the landscape.","date":"Jul 21, 2023","bsTitle":"Connecting the dots","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230721_BridgeNorway%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cd70bc865e61cb18d912c88f8b2a87de","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
