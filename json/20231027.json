The bridge arches over a river of the same name, and carries only cyclists and pedestrians, while a modern bridge downstream serves cars. From atop the bridge's weathered, mossy stones, travelers can take in the majestic Cuillin Mountains in the distance. According to local tradition, the Sligachan River's water contains a mysterious blessing provided by fairies. Those who dare to immerse their faces in these waters are said to be gifted with timeless beauty.","date":"Oct 27, 2023","bsTitle":"Enchanted waters run deep","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231027_OldBridgeSkye%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7407bfea2fd386c1feca4edb6772b1c3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
