The Mekong River experiences flooding every year, which turns this river into a photographer's paradise. Adorned with elegant lilies that are nourished by the floods, farmers in the Long An province, in southeastern Vietnam, dedicate their days to harvesting the bloom of the plants. The annual floods bring in nutrients from upstream, enriching the fields and helping these flowers grow. These lilies also provide a food supply and contribute to the community's economy since the stems are edible and the plant can be brewed into tea. These long-stemmed flowers pay tribute to nature's ability to generate moments of amazing beauty that inspire and uplift the human soul.","date":"Oct 19, 2023","bsTitle":"Teamwork makes the dream work","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231019_WaterLilyVietnam%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"7e98ec66caecf5325e0d1cbc23e492eb","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
