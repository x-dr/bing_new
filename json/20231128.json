That's where Giving Tuesday comes in. This annual holiday on the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving was created by the United Nations Foundation and New York's 92nd Street Y—a cultural organization and community center—in 2012. Their vision was to make a difference by providing joy to everyone through acts of charity. Generosity is something we can all practice, whether by volunteering at a non-profit organization, shelter or food bank, donating to a charity, or simply giving a voice to people in need in your community. So, let's jump on board with the millions of kind souls, shake hands, and share warm wishes far and wide!","date":"Nov 28, 2023","bsTitle":"A day to lend a hand","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231128_HumanKindness%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"1701f6db031494795798a84b762297e9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
