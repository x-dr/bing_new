Forests and ancient temples sit side-by-side in the park, beneath the three granite peaks of Bukhan Mountain, or Bukhansan. Among the park's ridges and valleys, water deer, wild boar, chipmunks, and squirrels roam freely. A careful ear might pick out the rat-a-tat of woodpeckers or the chirpy melody of songbirds perched in the trees. The park also boasts Bukhansanseong Fortress, whose current structure was completed in 1711.","date":"Jan 12, 2024","bsTitle":"Beautiful Bukhansan","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240112_BukhansanSeoul%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"eafe67c6e0eeb1a9a100da1d53c76871","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
