Iceboating, also known as ice sailing, began in 17th-century Europe. Travelers used vessels on blades to traverse the frozen Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea and the iced-over canals of the Netherlands. These days, the sport is enjoyed as a recreational and competitive activity using a variety of boats, boards, skates, and kites. The world championships, which fall under the broader umbrella of windsurfing competitions, have been held since 1980. Good luck to all those out there competing for fame and glory on the windswept ice!","date":"Jan 30, 2023","bsTitle":"Wind-powered ice racing","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230130_IceSailingBalaton%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"8c16c5ad084fe41d8b43641125ffa0cf","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
