The massive lake lies in the Sierra Nevada at an altitude of 6,225 feet, straddling the state line between California to the west and Nevada to the east with near perfect symmetry. Fannette Island is in Emerald Bay, on the California side of Tahoe's southwest shore. A narrow inlet, seen here at the top center of this image, connects Emerald Bay to the rest of the lake, whose natural beauty draws visitors in all seasons of the year.","date":"Jul 5, 2022","bsTitle":"This island is more than a mile high","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220705_FannetteIsland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"388ae90d015ddc0b35337b6a5f1c6fbc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
