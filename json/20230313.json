One of the most spectacular wildlife ecosystems on the planet, the park is home to rhinos, leopards, elephants, giraffes—and a huge lion population. The grassland here is dotted with rock formations that stick out like islands, the largest of which, the simba kopjes, are popular hangouts for lions and are said to have inspired Pride Rock in 'The Lion King.' In the heat of the Serengeti, lush trees provide the perfect shelter for lions to take a nap and reenergize. We hope you are as cozy as you curl up and recuperate on National Napping Day.","date":"Mar 13, 2023","bsTitle":"Just 'lion' around","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230313_LionessesNap%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fef9c41b13c34688ee175f19be20b199","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
