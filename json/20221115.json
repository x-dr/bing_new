They're a pair of North American river otters swimming in Maine's Acadia National Park. Technically members of the weasel family, these 'water dogs' aren't just locked into rivers. They can be found in other waterways and along the coasts of North America. A myopic animal with eyesight adapted to help with swimming, river otters will come right up on humans or boats, usually within a few feet.","date":"Nov 15, 2022","bsTitle":"You 'otter' check this out","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221115_LontraCanadensis%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"34b06a9f8595f867b461f49e8d73bbb2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
