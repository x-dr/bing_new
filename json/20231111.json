Over 41 million Americans have been in our military since the US Army was established in 1775, and today, on Veterans Day, we salute their service. Veterans Day started as Armistice Day, a commemoration of the end of combat in World War 1. In 1954, it was renamed Veterans Day, expanding its scope to honor all people who have served. Over 6% of Americans, more than 16 million people, are veterans. Their service will be recognised today at the Veterans Day National Ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, and in parades and other events across the country.","date":"Nov 11, 2023","bsTitle":"A salute to veterans","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231111_VeteransDayDC%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9a62463aeda015e2c5d9abceeed273c9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
