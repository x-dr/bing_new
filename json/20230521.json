Human habitation here dates back to at least the 3rd century BCE, when a Gallic tribe called the Parisii settled on an island in the middle of the river. Today, that island is known as the Île de la Cité, seen on the left of our photo, and is home to Notre-Dame cathedral, as well as other striking buildings such as the medieval Conciergerie, pictured here.","date":"May 21, 2023","bsTitle":"Spanning the Seine","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230521_PontdArcole%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"72a8e28acf00a52eb10443321b95094e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
