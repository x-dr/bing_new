Not only was it not established until this late date, but before the mid-20th century, much of the land here simply didn't exist. Flevoland was created through vast land reclamation projects in the 1950s and '60s. While the Dutch had been reforming their landscape to meet their changing needs for hundreds of years, the 20th century would see their most dramatic and ambitious projects realized. The province's anthem is the fitting 'Waar Wij Steden Doen Verrijzen' ('Where We Let Cities Arise'). It's an ode to pushing back the sea and creating a 'province that's not bad, youngest part of the Netherlands. Where it is nice to live, my beloved Flevoland!'","date":"Aug 28, 2022","bsTitle":"More of a mustache than a beard?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220828_BeardedTit%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"90f70bcdd8bfbdb22848e1e7c1917c77","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
