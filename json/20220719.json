The male American bison in today's photo is lazing among wildflowers in Yellowstone National Park, the only place in the country where there's been a continuous population of bison since prehistoric times. Once widespread across the American plains and revered by Native Americans, they numbered in the tens of millions. Tragically, settlers hunted the bison nearly to extinction by the late 1800s. Fewer than 1,000 of the giants were left in 1905 when the American Bison Society was formed to save them. These days, the population has stabilized with a little more than half a million bison spread across the country, with a few thousand living freely on the plains at Yellowstone.","date":"Jul 19, 2022","bsTitle":"Oh, give me a home","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220719_YellowstoneBison%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"12f0ca906ebf20c652be6bb22fa99d5c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
