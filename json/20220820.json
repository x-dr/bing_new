It's remarkable to consider that there are around 20,000 different species of bees in the world, but just eight species of honey bees. And it's sobering to realize how fragile their existence is. Billions of honey bees have disappeared over the last 15 years in what's known as colony collapse disorder. There's no definitive explanation for the die-off, though scientists believe pesticides, loss of habitat, climate change, mite infestation, and disease are contributing factors. Now we need to reintroduce bees and other pollinators to safeguard our food system.","date":"Aug 20, 2022","bsTitle":"Saving and celebrating honey bees","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220820_BearProof%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dcf6816e20d42e164bc97b5f862c9d9b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
