This wading bird is often referred to as the giant heron due to its enormous size—reaching as tall as 5 feet in height with up to a 7-foot wingspan. The goliath heron is a solitary creature, known for its slow, hunting-style movements and lives around lakes, swamps, and wetlands. They forage in deep waters and feast on large fish, like mullet and tilapia, as well as small animals including frogs, snakes, and lizards. They are often found in sub-Saharan Africa, with smaller numbers in western and southern regions of Asia.","date":"Jun 11, 2023","bsTitle":"A huddled giant","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230611_GoliathHeron%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c5367b2526ffc7e4f29b91ff9318d773","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
