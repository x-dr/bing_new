Big Bend National Park may be among the country's largest national parks with an area of over 800,000 acres (about the size of Rhode Island), but it's also one of the most remote. Found in West Texas along the Rio Grande at the Mexico border, the park entrance is roughly a two-hour drive from the nearest interstate. The good thing is, even in a 'busy' year when half a million people visit, there's plenty of space to enjoy the great outdoors unhindered by crowds.","date":"Jun 12, 2022","bsTitle":"A remote oasis in the Chihuahuan Desert","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220612_SierraPonce%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"735404a6394b1a71ca12f534ca874838","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
