The monument, established in 2000, was named after the vibrant red hues that dominate this sandstone landscape. Once you get a permit to take part in this outdoor excursion, make sure to visit the 'Wave.' It's a stunning geological wonder, with flowing layers of rocks that look like red liquid that has been frozen in time. Other visual treats include Cobra Arch and the White Pocket rock formations, featuring swirling patterns in white, red, and orange.","date":"Dec 3, 2023","bsTitle":"Sculpted by time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231203_VermilionCliffs%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ebfe4f3c594c6265ed00b2ab40c36715","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
