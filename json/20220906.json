It's National Mushroom Month, and it seems our red squirrel friend here in Alaska got a literal jump on celebrating. It might surprise you, but squirrels don't only eat nuts. They'll eat just about whatever's around and that includes big mushrooms. Though a small percentage of wild mushrooms can be poisonous to humans, squirrels can eat many of these frightening fungi without worry, thanks to special proteins in their guts. Nice to know someone's enjoying them.","date":"Sep 6, 2022","bsTitle":"A real fun guy…er, squirrel","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220906_SquirrelMushroom%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"40232c6cd4e080c40c842ae348d6a32c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
