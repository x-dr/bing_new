One of two towns in Lofoten, Svolvaer boasts a long history as a fishing village. Before it became a town of its own, it was part of the town of Vågan, where people have lived for over 1,000 years. Beyond fishing, it also serves as a sanctuary for travelers looking for a peaceful getaway, with as many as 200,000 visitors in a single year. The traditional rorbu houses, built on poles over water, add a distinctive layer of charm to the town. These cabins were once made for traveling fishermen and have now been refurbished to meet contemporary tastes.","date":"Dec 13, 2023","bsTitle":"All is calm","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231213_LofotenRorbu%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"081c3663c732b3ec23cf765b81af82ab","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
