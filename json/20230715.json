Its narrow alleys and cobblestone streets pass buildings that cling to the mountainside. This picturesque destination is brimming with history; from its rule by feudal lords to battles long forgotten. It's believed that the Normans settled here around the 11th century AD and constructed a castle, from which the village gets its name. Castelmezzano isn't just a sleepy portrait of the past, it also offers adventure activities for the brave, including a high-altitude zip line between mountains on the Volo dell'Angelo (Flight of the Angel). Yet the finest pleasure the small village offers might just be grabbing a cup of coffee and watching the sun rise behind the majestic mountain peaks, illuminating those huddled houses as the streetlamps go out.","date":"Jul 15, 2023","bsTitle":"A postcard-perfect landscape","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230715_CastelmazzanoSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4b8a97470624766ae0703ebf00176e53","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
