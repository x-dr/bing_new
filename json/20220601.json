Protected by a double barrier reef, it's home to unique marine life and coral, making it a bucket-list destination for divers. The beauty and diversity of species contained within its pristine 270 square miles are the perfect inspiration for World Reef Day, observed every year on June 1 to bring awareness to this vital but largely unseen part of our natural world. Reef Day also kicks off World Oceans Month, a time to celebrate and learn more about these indispensable ecosystems.","date":"Jun 1, 2022","bsTitle":"The beauty that lies below","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220601_MarovoLagoon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7c92d70813f6f7948f2d61dbf1e52e70","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
