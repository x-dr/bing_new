If so, consider a trip to Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) in northeast Minnesota. The Boundary Waters wilderness stretches for 150 miles along the US-Canada border within Superior National Forest. Known by those seeking solitude, Boundary Waters is one of America's most beautiful and remote locations. Formed long ago from the scraping and gouging of glaciers, the area is distinct with its rugged cliffs, canyons, and thousands of lakes and streams. More than 1,200 miles of canoe routes are enjoyed by thousands of people every year.","date":"Aug 13, 2022","bsTitle":"Canoeing in solitude","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220813_BoundaryWaters%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"320dc255a248d1c6cf95c1eb84c6d329","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
