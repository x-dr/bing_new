The tombs of four Achaemenid kings (you can see three of them here) are marked by rock reliefs carved high above the ground into the cliff face. This site and the area around it are of huge significance to the history of Iran and its people. They're also a shining example of the role archaeology plays in understanding our past. On the third Saturday of every October, we pause to celebrate and recognize the contributions of archaeologists as interpreters of human history.","date":"Oct 15, 2022","bsTitle":"Final resting place of kings","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221015_NaqsheRustam%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7ac627da622a63760c9b2704d0fe2800","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
