The island has a rich history, having been settled by the Greeks, Romans, and other civilizations over the centuries, but is less well-known than its larger neighbours, Capri and Ischia. Its oldest fishing village, Marina Corricella, features pastel-colored buildings and narrow streets and is a great place to enjoy fresh seafood and soak up the atmosphere. From there, you can climb up to the fortified medieval village of Terra Murata, built on the island's highest point, which offers panoramic views over the entire Gulf of Naples.","date":"Apr 21, 2023","bsTitle":"Sunset on Procida","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230421_ProcidaItaly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"16c7e535394acfa37c4eb84904f1b1ec","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
