Box turtles are named after their dome-shaped shells which are hinged at the bottom, allowing the shell to close like a box if it needs to hide from predators. They generally live for around 25 years but can survive for more than 50, and there have been reports of some living for 100 years.","date":"May 23, 2023","bsTitle":"Turtle power!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230523_WesternBoxTurtle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"64b61efe4d4aedbf07afda40c19669e3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
