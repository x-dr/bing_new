It's not just a place to shop but a destination as popular as any in the City of Light.

It has survived financial crises, wars, and now the internet, remaining a celebrated part of life in Paris.

A giant fir is decorated every holiday season under the store's signature stained glass dome—a ritual of Christmas cheer that Parisians have embraced for generations.","date":"Dec 22, 2022","bsTitle":"Season of light in the City of Light","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221222_TreeGaleriesLafayette%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"2fe6fe00c53c6395558a9347e11a2049","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
