The capital of the Netherlands charms visitors with its historic canals, versatile architecture, and laid-back vibe. The city's history can be traced back to the 12th century when it was a fishing village on the banks of the Amstel River. Institutions like the Van Gogh Museum, the Eye Film Museum, and the National Maritime Museum offer insights into its history and arts legacy. Amsterdam's canal ring area, built at the turn of the 17th century, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city is also home to its fair share of restaurants, vintage shops, and outdoor markets in neighborhoods like Oud-West, pictured in today's image. Get ready to pedal because Amsterdam's cycling culture is ubiquitous. With approximately 320 miles of bike lanes, it's one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world.","date":"Dec 29, 2023","bsTitle":"Oud-West side story","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231229_BlueAmsterdam%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"400bef3980f3637507f7f8cc5f87c627","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
