The name of the village and beach—Ölüdeniz—literally means 'Dead Sea,' a reference to the calm water, but it's better known as Turkey's Blue Lagoon for the stretch of tranquil waters set off from the ocean by a long sandbar. Much of the area is protected inside a national park, and the Ölüdeniz beach proudly holds the Blue Flag certification by the Foundation for Environmental Education, which recognizes high environmental and quality standards.","date":"Jul 10, 2022","bsTitle":"A beach of many colors","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220710_OludenizTurkey%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9a730a9d877dac17f9ec252a9bf06652","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
