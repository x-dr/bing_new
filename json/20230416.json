The date of this magical invention is unknown, but the first written documentation of kite flying comes from China in 200 BCE. There they were initially used to measure distance, but over the years they have been tapped for fishing, sport, science, celebration, communication, and recreation. Kites can take many shapes and be made of various materials, but all of them have a wing surface, a tether, and a bridle that keeps the surface at an angle to the wind. In fact, you can easily make your own, and there's no better time than today: Go Fly a Kite Day.","date":"Apr 16, 2023","bsTitle":"Go fly a kite!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230416_KiteDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2e9f002d883be1c389d2fabab95bb6df","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
