But there are thought to be fewer than 80 alive today, surviving only on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Logging and hunting have led to their inclusion on the ‘red list’ of more than 42,100 critically endangered species. This one is pictured in Way Kambas National Park, Sumatra, where a rhino sanctuary is home to a tiny population and is the center of a breeding and research program.","date":"May 19, 2023","bsTitle":"On the edge of extinction","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230519_SumatranRhino%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1939d5a4538996367a1e55ca7456bc70","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
