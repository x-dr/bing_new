They include what is perhaps the most famous geyser of them all: Old Faithful. But the Upper Basin contains many other geysers as well, including the tallest predictable geyser (Grand Geyser) and the most voluminous geyser (Giant Geyser). Yellowstone contains about 500 geysers, roughly two-thirds the number in the entire world.","date":"Sep 27, 2022","bsTitle":"Where fire and water meet","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220927_YellowstoneUGB%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"46e957301b90c5933da632acafc36897","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
