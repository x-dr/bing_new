Apples made their way to North America with European colonists in the 17th century. In 1625, the first apple orchard in North America was planted in Boston by William Blaxton. Today, from Red Delicious to Honeycrisp to Pink Lady, some 200 varieties are grown in the US. The chaffinch on our homepage today is pictured amid tiny crab apples. Sure, they can be a bit tart, but they make for a lovely display in winter and some birds depend on them when other food is scarce. Sliced, baked, in a salad, or as cider, how do you like them apples?","date":"Jan 6, 2024","bsTitle":"Crab an apple!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240106_CrabappleChaffinch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9bbe0acbf48f4e1e2ba73ceaf6a7e801","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
