This Alpine village in the canton of Grisons is surely the envy and inspiration of snow globes the world over! Located just a few miles from the Italian border, the impossibly perfect winter scenes found here have inspired painters and artists for centuries. Majola is near Lake Sils, which makes this area a recreational destination in both summer and winter. At the center of our image is the crown jewel of Maloja, the Chiesa Bianca, a church built in the 1880s by a Belgian count. Today, the once solemn space is used to stage exhibitions and concerts.","date":"Dec 28, 2022","bsTitle":"A life-size snow globe","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20221228_ChiesaBianca%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cbb929eb095c13312f2743de6410ad35","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
