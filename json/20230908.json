The largest is held here, in the English city of Bath, where Austen lived from 1801 to 1806. On September 8, International Literacy Day, the city begins its annual 10-day Jane Austen Festival with hundreds of Austen fans walking the streets dressed in costumes from Britain's Regency era, in the early 19th century.","date":"Sep 8, 2023","bsTitle":"Jane Austen's literary circle","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230908_BathCircus%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6f220db1682d9be0d96b21a19fd1e5e2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
