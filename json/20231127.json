It is also the largest blackwater river in the world, its water stained by decomposing organic matter that seeps in from swamps. These slow-moving, dark waters beautifully reflect the colors of the sky, including the rainbows which form over the Amazon basin, as seen here. The river also plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, as the home of many plants and animals, including the critically endangered Brazilian barefaced tamarin, the giant river otter, and nearly 700 species of fish.","date":"Nov 27, 2023","bsTitle":"Mirror, mirror, on the water","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231127_RioNegro%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"30cc7f715dfb09e1db2f4dda8131dae8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
