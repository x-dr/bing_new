Squeezed into a small Norwegian fishing village, it's fair to say that Henningsvær Stadion's grounds will probably never host a UEFA Champions League. But, while it lacks stands for spectators, there's still plenty of atmosphere to soak up in this striking location. Those who play here do so surrounded by the sound of waves, seabirds, and the smells of salt air and cod, drying on the racks surrounding the pitch.","date":"May 11, 2023","bsTitle":"Pitch perfect","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20230511_FootballField%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"da4f6391d7de54423a3c18018e486b54","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
